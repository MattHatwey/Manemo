1 WEEK LATER

"...WE'VE ARRIVED!" said Rainflower. Everyone woke up. It was beautiful. Neptune was green.

Rainflower ran towards the exit. Bubble and Sirius followed. "Rainflower let's play!" said Sirius and Bubble. "Not another prank, right?" said Rainflower. "No!" said Sirius. "Not really!" said Bubble. "Hey!!" "What?" "You ruined the prank." "Not really. It wasn't funny anyway. I was just saying the truth!!!" said Bubble.

"Heles, can we stick to my plan?" asked Reverse. "Nope! Today is no-plan day!" said Heles. "Again?" "Yep!" "Ok...." "Here we go!!!!" said Heles.

Everyone started cleaning Neptune.

1 MONTH LATER

"Phew. It's done." said Everyone.

"Look at Neptune!" said Everyone.

"WOW!" said Everyone.

Neptune looked completely different. It looked sparkly and bubbly. There were many clouds floating around.

"Let me try planting it." said Rainflower to Meru. "There's no dirt anywhere though!" said Meru, angrily. "Maybe I can plant it in the ground like this!" said Rainflower, digging a hole in the ground. "Wait...What?" said Meru.

Rainflower planted a star-plant. It started growing. Many insects started flying around, and soon ponds were made, birds came, reptiles came, mammals came, and more plants started growing. 

"Aww, look at that sloth!" said Rainflower. "Yeah, I wonder what they taste like?" said Meru, laughing. Rainflower slapped Meru, and Meru never talked about cooking and eating sloths, or any other animal.

"I would like to live here," said Rainflower. "Sounds good!" said Everyone. Suddenly Rainflower started glowing. She looked similar to the godess of stars. Maybe she was the godess of plants. 

"Thank you..." said Legendaria.

Suddenly the godess of stars and Legendaria and Legendarius appeared.

"You are the second one. And I see that there are a few more." said the godess of stars.

"Yes, you are right, Enchendaria." said Legendaria.

"You mean the godess of stars?" said Matt.

"No, star is Enchendaria.

"WHAT?" said everyone.

"You." said Legendaria.

"Now I really feel like a god!" said Matt. "Should we go home now?" asked Sansei. "Maybe." said Honest. "I want to go back home!" said Hatwey. "Okay. Should we go then?" said Matt.

"YAY!" said Hatwey.

The trip back to Manemo Land was boring.

"We've arrived!" said Matt, happily. "Finally. Honest, watcha lookin at?" asked Hatwey. "Can you believe this!? There's this planet called Earth, and these things called humans are calling Manemo Land URANUS!!!" said Honest. "WHAT!??" said everyone. "That's a dumb name." said Sansei. 

"How about we rename it?" asked Snow, suddenly.

"Wow! I thought you'd never say a word." said everyone.

"..." said Snow, angrily.

"How about Caelus?" said Calipi.

"Oh, that's a good name! Where did that name come from?" asked Bubble.

"I don't know." said Calipi.

The Manemos were waiting until everyone came out of the rocket.

"Make a map!" said one kid.

"Wait, that's a great idea!" said Matt.

-5 HOURS LATER-

"...So this town would be" said Honest. "Sunlight Town!" said Bubble and Sirius and the other kids younger than them. "Since we live here, this is the first place to see the sunrise." said Matt.

"The grassland region can be renamed as the plains." said Sansei.

"Is that all?" asked Matt.

"Probably..." said Honest and Hatwey.

"Okay, then!" said Matt.

"EVERYONE!" said Matt. "We're almost done!!" 

"YAY!!!" said everyone.
