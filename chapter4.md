1 WEEK LATER

"...WE'VE ARRIVED!" said Rainflower. Everyone woke up. It was beautiful. Neptune was green.

Rainflower ran towards the exit. Bubble and Sirius followed. "Rainflower let's play!" said Sirius and Bubble. "Not another prank, right?" said Rainflower. "No!" said Sirius. "Not really!" said Bubble. "Hey!!" "What?" "You ruined the prank." "Not really. It wasn't funny anyway. I was just saying the truth!!!" said Bubble.

"Heles, can we stick to my plan?" asked Reverse. "Nope! Today is no-plan day!" said Heles. "Again?" "Yep!" "Ok...." "Here we go!!!!" said Heles.

Everyone started cleaning Neptune.

1 MONTH LATER

"Phew. It's done." said Everyone.

"Look at Neptune!" said Everyone.

"WOW!" said Everyone.
