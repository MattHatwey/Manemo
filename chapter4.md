1 WEEK LATER

"...WE'VE ARRIVED!" said Rainflower. Everyone woke up. It was beautiful. Neptune was green.

Rainflower ran towards the exit. Bubble and Sirius followed. "Rainflower let's play!" said Sirius and Bubble. "Not another prank, right?" said Rainflower. "No!" said Sirius. "Not really!" said Bubble. "Hey!!" "What?" "You ruined the prank." "Not really. It wasn't funny anyway. I was just saying the truth!!!" said Bubble.

"Heles, can we stick to my plan?" asked Reverse. "Nope! Today is no-plan day!" said Heles. "Again?" "Yep!" "Ok...." "Here we go!!!!" said Heles.

Everyone started cleaning Neptune.

1 MONTH LATER

"Phew. It's done." said Everyone.

"Look at Neptune!" said Everyone.

"WOW!" said Everyone.

Neptune looked completely different. It looked sparkly and bubbly. There were many clouds floating around.

"Thank you..." said Legendaria.

Suddenly the godess of stars and Legendaria and Legendarius appeared.

"You are the second one. And I see that there are a few more." said the godess of stars.

"Yes, you are right, Enchendaria." said Legendaria.

"You mean the godess of stars?" said Matt.

"No, star is Enchendaria.

"WHAT?" said everyone.

"You." said Legendaria.

"You are the godess of plants and animals, or the godess of life." said Legendaria, pointing at Rainflower.

"You are the god of soul."

"You are the god of birds."

"You are the god of spirit."

"You are the god of illusion." 

"You are the god of wilderness."

"You are the godess of lies."

"You are the godess of war."

"You are the godess of love."

"You are the godess of gemstones." 

"You are the godess of sealife." 

"You are the godess of sea."

"You are the godess of charms."

"You are the godess of reversal."

"You are the godess of
