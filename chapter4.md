1 WEEK LATER

"...WE'VE ARRIVED!" said Rainflower. Everyone woke up. It was beautiful. Neptune was green.

Rainflower ran towards the exit. Bubble and Sirius followed. "Rainflower let's play!" said Sirius and Bubble. "Not another prank, right?" said Rainflower. "No!" said Sirius. "Not really!" said Bubble. "Hey!!" "What?" "You ruined the prank." "Not really. It wasn't funny anyway. I was just saying the truth!!!" said Bubble.

"Heles, can we stick to my plan?" asked Reverse. "Nope! Today is no-plan day!" said Heles. "Again?" "Yep!" "Ok...." "Here we go!!!!" said Heles.

Everyone started cleaning Neptune.

1 MONTH LATER

"Phew. It's done." said Everyone.

"Look at Neptune!" said Everyone.

"WOW!" said Everyone.

Neptune looked completely different. It looked sparkly and bubbly. There were many clouds floating around.

"Let me try planting it." said Rainflower to Meru. "There's no dirt anywhere though!" said Meru, angrily. "Maybe I can plant it in the ground like this!" said Rainflower, digging a hole in the ground. "Wait...What?" said Meru.

Rainflower planted a star-plant. It started growing. Many insects started flying around, and soon ponds were made, birds came, reptiles came, mammals came, and more plants started growing. 

"Aww, look at that sloth!" said Rainflower. "Yeah, I wonder what they taste like?" said Meru, laughing. Rainflower slapped Meru, and Meru never talked about cooking and eating sloths, or any other animal.

"I would like to live here," said Rainflower. "Sounds good!" said Everyone. Suddenly Rainflower started glowing. She looked similar to the godess of stars. Maybe she was the godess of plants. 

"Thank you..." said Legendaria.

Suddenly the godess of stars and Legendaria and Legendarius appeared.

"You are the second one. And I see that there are a few more." said the godess of stars.

"Yes, you are right, Enchendaria." said Legendaria.

"You mean the godess of stars?" said Matt.

"No, star is Enchendaria.

"WHAT?" said everyone.

"You." said Legendaria.

...Please check Characters for the rest of the gods and godesses.

"Now I really feel like a god!" said Matt. "Should we go home now?" asked Sansei. "Maybe." said Honest. "I want to go back home!" said Hatwey. "Okay. Should we go then?" said Matt.

"YAY!" said Hatwey.

The trip back to Manemo Land was boring.

"We've arrived!" said Matt, happily. "Finally. Honest, watcha lookin at?" asked Hatwey. "Can you believe this!? There's this planet called Earth, and these things called humans are calling Manemo Land URANUS!!!" said Honest. "WHAT!??" said everyone. "That's a dumb name." said Sansei. 

"How about we rename it?" asked Snow, suddenly.

"Wow! I thought you'd never say a word." said everyone.

"..." said Snow, angrily.

"How about Caelus?" said Calipi.

"Oh, that's a good name! Where did that name come from?" asked Bubble.

"I don't know." said Calipi.

The Manemos were waiting until everyone came out of the rocket.

"Make a map!" said one kid.

"Wait, that's a great idea!" said Matt.

-1 HOUR LATER-

"...So this town would be" said Honest. "Sunlight Town!" said Bubble and Sirius and the other kids younger than them. "Since we live here, this is the first place to see the sunrise." said Matt.

"Crystal Tower could be part of Sunlight Town." said Matt.

"The Swamp right there could also be part of Sunlight Town. The tiny desert, too." said Honest.

"That tiny plain area is gonna be called Meru's spotlight!" said Meru and Heather.

"NOPE!" said Heles and Reverse.

"It's gonna be the called The first entrance to the heaven-like city where we found flame and shirottori- and it's also a very small plain! right?" said Reverse and Heles.

"I think it should just be part of Sunlight Town." said Heather.

Calipi and Snow nodded.

"Okay, sounds good." said Sansei.

"What else?" said Hatwey, very inpatiently.

"Yeah, what else?" said Heles, also inpatiently.

"Hmm.." said Matt and Honest.

"The grassland region can be renamed as the plains." said Sansei.

"Oh finally a suggestion which isn't part of Sunlight Town." said Heles and Bubble and Sirius.

"Over there would be Cloud City, where Aves was found." said Sansei.

"That would be Sky Village? With the Sky Marketplace?" said Matt.

"Sounds good!" said Hatwey.

"Also, next to Cloud City is Cute City." said Kacchan. She regretted what she said 5 seconds later.

"Why? Just make it part of Cloud City." said mostly everyone.

"That area does have a lot of Idol Concerts!" said Obsidian, who instantly regretted saying anything.

Kacchan stared at Obsidian and whispered "You weren't supposed to say anything!" Obsidian just looked at Kacchan.

"Is Kacchan an Idol?" asked one innocent Manemo.

Matt stared at Kacchan. "We'll talk about this later."

Kacchan just stared at the ground.

"The Badland Territory could be divided into the Volcano of Evil, Blood Lake, Forest of the Dead, Bloodflower plains." said Calipi, very calmly.

"Wow, those names are horrifying." said Matt.

"What else?" said Heles again, more inpatiently.

"Is that all?" asked Matt.

"Probably..." said Honest and Hatwey.

"Okay, then!" said Matt.

"EVERYONE!" said Matt. "We think we're done!!" 

"YAY!!!" said everyone.

The next day, Matt and Sansei asked Obsidian and Kacchan to come home early.

"Why did you bring me here?" said Obsidian and Kacchan, although, they knew why.

"You know why. Explain to me." said Matt.

"I am an Idol, named Pink." said Kacchan.

"REALLY?!!?!?!" said Matt and Sansei. "Although you look similar, I never knew.

"Then which Idol did you think I was?" said Kacchan.

"I thought you were trying to hide a very deep secret from us. I didn't think you were an idol!" said Matt. "And when Obsidian said something about Idols, we thought he loved Idols or something." said Sansei.

"The reason I hid this secret was because I started when I was 7. I didn't participate school properly." said Kacchan.

"It's okay." said Matt and Sansei.

"Can we tell the rest of the Crystal Tower?" asked Matt.

"Yes." said Kacchan and Obsidian, happily. Now that they had admitted what happened, they felt very happy.

"Hello~?" said one voice.

"Shut up" said another.

"Um, where are we?" said another voice.

"I don't know. What do you think?" said another voice.

"..." said another.

The voices came closer towards Matt and the others, and they could see their head. One was black with cute decorations, one was blonde, one was blonde with a black and gold mesh, one was blonde with many blue stripes. Finally, one was just black.

"Hi!!!" said a voice they heard earlier.

"Hello! Who are you?" said Matt.

"I'm Rigel! And I'm 7 years old!" said Rigel.

Rigel was blonde with a black and gold mesh.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Matt" said Matt.

"I'm Sansei." said Sansei.

"I'm Heles!!!" said Heles.

"Hehehe!" said Rigel.

"I am Orion. Nice to meet you." said Orion, who was blonde.

"I'm Mira!" said Mira.

Mira had black hair, and cute decorations on top.

"I'm Castor." said Castor, who was blonde with many blue stripes.

"I'm Vega." said Vega, who had black hair.

"Nice to meet you all!" said Matt and Sansei.

Meru and Castor were very similar, but Castor was pretty cruel. Orion was like Esper, Mira was like Crystal and Mist combined, and she was very lively. Rigel was like Sirius, he was pure, and liked to prank people (not as much as Bubble, but more than Sirius). Vega was like Calipi and Kacchan combined.

"Castor, I win because I already have a girlfriend!!!" said Meru, who brought Heather over.

"Hello!" said Heather. It was just Heather, and she greeted everyone earlier, but Castor didn't pay close attention. Heather was very cute.

"Are you trying to beat me?" said Castor. "Yes." said Meru. "Well then, get ready to fight!" said Castor. "But I already won!" said Meru.

"No you didn't." said Castor.

"Why?" asked Meru. "Look behind." said Castor.

Meru looked. It was Mira, but Meru didn't see her closely when they greeted Matt and Sansei. Mira was beautiful.

"Hi again! What was your name?" said Mira.

"Did I meet you?" said Meru, confused.

Meru and Castor were now tied. Meru had Heather. Castor had Mira. Meanwhile Mira and Heather became friends.

"Want me to do your hair? It looks pretty tangled." said Mira.

"Really? Well then, please do my hair!" said Heather. "Do you like Meru?" asked Mira. "Yes! He is so cute." said Heather. "I love Castor." said Mira. "They are similar." said Heather. "True!" said Mira. 

"I love them both." said Mira and Heather.

Meru and Castor overheard the conversation. They decided to pretend they didn't hear it.

"Do you have guns?" asked Castor.

"Yeah!" said Meru.

"How many?" asked Castor, holding 2 guns in his hand.

"More than you." said Meru, holding a sack of guns.

"I bet not." said Castor, also holding a sack of guns.

They started counting all the guns they had that were in their sack they carried.

"27!" said Castor and Meru.

"Maybe we are born to be friends, not rivals!" said Meru.

"True. Nice to meet you, Meru." said Castor.

"What's your favorite gun?" asked Castor.

"Mine is
