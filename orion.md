Orion

To this day, I will never know what happened in my life in the past. It will always be a mystery, but I think that is what makes my life special.

I was thinking about the past, when suddenly, 4 other Manemos came. Vega, Castor, Mira, and Rigel. I will never forget that day.

We soon realized we were born in the same place. It was those dark prison cells.

Vega, the oldest, caught my attention. Everyday, she would stare at me for hours. She was very pure and cute. I loved her. I tried to pat her on the head, but she ran away. At first, I thought she didn't like me. But soon, I realised that she liked me too.

Soon, the memories of the past faded away, but since that first day that I met Vega and the others, I never forgot anything anyone said or did. Even the first day I met them started to become more vivid the more I thought about it.

Recently, we escaped the prison cell. We ran toward the sunrise. As the sun rose, we watched everything come to life. The flowers, the animals, the sky, everything seemed to come to life. It felt like a miracle to me. It was so beautiful, and I will never forget that miracle.

We were soon chatting together, happily, until we saw a town infront of us. Then, two Manemos came. Their names were Matt and Sansei, and they let us stay in their beautiful Crystal-like Tower.
