War. It was easy to start, but hard to end.

Distant sirens, an ambulance, or a firetruck. Police cars were driving around. Manemos were running, and screaming. Only the injured ones. The others slept through the sound.

For some reason, nobody could use magic, except for the Bad Manemos.

Until today, everything was fine. It was only a week after Vega and the others came.

Matt woke up and quickly ran toward the security code to the diamond. It was broken. He tried to fix it, but nothing worked. 

Sansei ran towards Matt. So did Hatwey and the others in the crystal tower, besides the children. Matt knew if he fixed the diamond first instead of saving his children, everyone would be saved. When the diamond would not fix, Matt panicked. 

Earon was caught and captured first, then Wisteria, then Ichigo, then Choco, and finally, Rainflower. Hatwey and Honest looked around, searching for safety. 

Suddenly, a Bad Manemo came up to Matt. 

Matt was teleported to a different dimention. Hatwey and Honest cam back to see what happened. Soon Sansei, Honest and Hatwey were also teleported to a different dimention. It was still 3:51AM when they got send to the different dimention.

Kacchan heard the noise and started packing her belongings. She was packing, and thinking. "It they don't make it, what will happen to the memories and pictures that they had?" A tear dropped on her skirt. She collected the most valuable items. Then she started opening the doors of everyone's rooms and shouting: "WAR! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!"

Obsidian quickly packed, and waited outside for Kacchan to come. She had brought everything valuable or something she thought was priceless, like the photo album they had made a few years back.

Obsidian ran to Flame's room, and woke her up. Haru and Kiwi were still asleep. He tried to wake them up, but nothing worked.

They ran as fast as possible, shouting the same thing Kacchan had said to the others.

It was still 4:00AM and nobody really was awake.

Calipi opened her eyes, to see a dark sky, filled with smoke, and ashes, and foggy stars. She saw a lot of fire. She thought of the past. This fire felt nostalgic to her. Although, this was way worse. Calipi ran toward Snow, hugged him, and then shook him until he woke up. Kiwi came to see what happened, and she just stared at the surroundings. They started packing.

Snow was still very tired. It was 5:00AM now. Kiwi just sat on Snow's shoulder. The Manemo airport was burning. Everything was burning.

Kiwi brought a baggage cart from the airport. Kiwi sat on top of the many items Calipi and Snow and she brought with them.

Orion woke up, and so did Vega. Vega started packing all their belongings. Orion tried to wake up the rest of the Manemos sleeping in the Crystal Tower. They didn't wake up. It was still 5AM.

Orion saw Calipi, Snow and Kiwi in near the airport. He quickly grabbed Vega (she was done packing), and ran towards Calipi.

Heather woke up right as Orion and Vega went off to the airport. 

She quickly packed her and Meru and Haru's items, gathered some extra items, grabbed a few snacks, and woke Meru up. He instantly woke up because his favorite girlfriend woke him up. Meru quickly woke Haru up, and piggybacked her. 

Meru shouted at Castor: "Get up. There's a war going on!!!"

Castor bolted up, and gathered his and Meru's guns. "Oh, I almost forgot that one that I borrowed from you." said Meru. He gave the gun to Castor. Castor gave one of Meru's guns that he borrowed back. "Thanks" they said to each other. 

Castor shook Mira awake, and carried her. Mira jumped off, gathered all the items she needed, and got back on Castor's back. She was half-asleep. 

Heather ran towards Mist's room and called. Mist could not hear her. Heather sadly gave up.

The 5 of them ran towards the plains to gather Meru and Castor's fan merch. Then, they ran towards the sea. The docks were all burned down.

Mist woke up. She ran to collect her items, and quickly looked in everyone's room and said: "THERE IS A WAR GOING ON!!! WE NEED TO RUN NOW!!!!!!!!!" Then she ran away, off toward the forest.

Aves woke up. He gathered everything he and Esper and Crystal needed, then woke Esper and Crystal up. They ran toward the mountain range.

Esper and Crystal hugged Aves, and thanked him for waking them up. Aves also hugged them back.

Bubble woke up and so did Sirius. It was 5:30AM now. They gathered snacks, and their belongings. They waited around for a minute or two, but they soon became impatient. They shook Rigel until he woke up, which he did. Rigel carried a few items, then they all ran towards the forest.

Heles and Reverse were next to leave. They packed a few items, looked for anything else they might need, and looked in everyone's rooms. They were last to leave. They stayed in the crystal tower.

Meanwhile, Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest were in a weird place. They were in a strange box. Matt was in the grass, Sansei in the ocean, Hatwey was in the snow, and Honest was in the desert.

Matt found a heart in the middle of the grassy area. He touched it, and he felt warm. He saw the broken diamond. He looked at it, and touched it. He was surrounded by warm objects. The diamond spun around, and Matt touched it. Suddenly it became cold again. He was in a cave.

Sansei swam to the bottom of the ocean. She found a glowing star. She touched it. It swam away. It felt warm. She wrapped her arms around it. It stopped moving. She suddenly teleported to a cold cave.

Hatwey walked around in the snow. She saw a glowing star in the twilight sky. She stared at it. Then she jumped, and grabbed the star. She held it tightly in her hands. She also suddenly teleported to a cold cave.

Honest lay down in the sand. He saw a glowing star flying around him. He grasped it. He held it tightly in his arms. He also suddenly teleported to a cold cave.

Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest saw a glowing chest in the cave. They ran toward it, and they opened it. A glowing light pierced through the darkness. Matt saw Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest. So did Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest.

They stared at the cave. Hatwey held the star toward Matt. Sansei and Honest did the same. Matt showed the broken diamond, and the heart. The stars went around the heart, and above the heart was the broken diamond. The heart spun around, and the stars changed shape. One became Peace, another became Fire, and another became Magic. The heart changed to a Snowflake. The diamond and the Snowflake collided. So did the Peace, Fire, and Magic. 

The diamond was fixed. They all touched the diamond, and suddenly, they were back to the real world. Earon and the others waited for them to free them from the cages.

They were lost. The fire was burning everything down. Matt and the others still could not use magic.

Matt and the others saw an army of Bad Manemos running toward them. Matt and the others gave up. 

Suddenly, Legendaria appeared. "I cannot help you. Please do not give up. I believe that you can win." She disappeared.

Matt looked at the sky. So did the others. Then, suddenly, Pattern and Arabelle and the Prince appeared. They used their magic to kill the Bad Manemos. Greenstar and Galaxystar appeared. They also helped to kill the Bad Manemos.

The Bad Manemos were gone. Greenstar and Galaxystar disappeared.

Matt looked around. The houses and buildings were all restored. Everything was back to normal. The smoke and fire was gone. The sky was beautiful. It was dawn, but stars were shining brightly. The moon and sun rose. The clouds were pink and yellow. They saw a large pink and yellow cloud with windows. It was like a city. Matt said "Look, It's Kirari-Machi(Shining City)! I call it that.".

Kacchan stared at the sky on the roof of a house. She watched the moment that the houses and buildings were restored. She watched in disbelief. 

Obsidian sat next to her, blankly looking at the sky... 

Flame stared at the sky, and thought of heaven. She smiled.

Calipi looked at the buildings and houses from the now restored airport. She wished her home could be restored like that. She felt sad.

Snow looked at the sky blankly. He was reminded of the pirate and the boat. Then he was reminded of Shirottori-. He smiled, knowing that they were the same Manemo. 

Kiwi looked down at the ground, and saw a sprout grow into a beautiful flower. She looked at it from her teary and blurry eyes. She closed her eyes. She thought Haru would be near the dock. She grew a Kiwi tree near the sea. She smiled through the tears.

Vega stared at the stars. She thought about how scared she used to be, until Orion and the others came. Right when she was thinking about how Orion was there to comfort her even if she ran away, she smiled as she saw the Orion star go near the Vega star. 

Orion looked at Vega, smiling. Orion wished he knew Vega for longer, and wished he remembered what they did. Vega leaned against Orion. Orion pat her on the back.

Heather looked at the sky, and smiled. She felt strange.

Meru stared at everything come to life. He thought it was amazing. He liked it.

Haru looked at her feet. She saw the airport and felt like Kiwi would be there. She grew a flower near the airport. She looked at the ground. She saw a Kiwi plant growing into a tree. She smiled for a second. Then she started to cry silently. Then she looked back at the airport. She smiled through the tears.

Castor stared at everything come to life. He thought it was amazing. He liked it. It felt just like the day he escaped together with Mira and the others.

Mira was looking at everything. She was amazed. She was smiling. Sometimes she would be surprised.

Mist watched the city return to its glory. She was happy that everything was being fixed.

Bubble smiled. She looked at Sirius and laughed.

Sirius smiled. She looked at Bubble and laughed.

Aves looked at the beautiful view as the buildings and houses repaired themselves. He smiled, knowing that Leaf would be there tomorrow to greet him.

Esper looked around. He wished his life was better. He wanted his heart to feel fixed, just like the towns and cities. Crystal hugged him and said "I'm happy that I was born with you! I love you!" Esper cried, then smiled.

Crystal watched Esper. Crystal wanted to help because her favorite person was down. Crystal hugged Esper. She said "I'm happy that I was born with you! I love you!". She watched Esper cry and smile.

Heles watched as their house (Crystal Tower) was getting repaired. She smiled. She laughed and said "I'm glad that the houses are fixed!"

Reverse stared at the beautiful constellations. Then, she looked at the sky. She saw the beautiful view and smiled.
