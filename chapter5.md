War. It was easy to start, but hard to end.

Distant sirens, an ambulance, or a firetruck. Police cars were driving around. Manemos were running, and screaming. Only the injured ones. The others slept through the sound.

Kacchan heard the noise and started packing her belongings. She was packing, and thinking. "It they don't make it, what will happen to the memories and pictures that they had?" A tear dropped on her skirt. She collected the most valuable items. Then she started opening the doors of everyone's rooms and shouting: "WAR! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!"

Obsidian quickly packed, and waited outside for Kacchan to come. She had brought everything valuable or something she thought was priceless, like the photo album they had made a few years back.

They ran as fast as possible, shouting the same thing Kacchan had said to the others.

It was still 4:00AM and nobody really was awake.

Calipi opened her eyes, to see a dark sky, filled with smoke, and ashes, and foggy stars. She saw a lot of fire. She thought of the past. This fire felt nostalgic to her. Although, this was way worse. Calipi ran toward Snow, hugged him, and then shook him until he woke up. Kiwi came to see what happened, and she just stared at the surroundings. They started packing.

Snow was still very tired. It was 5:00AM now. Kiwi just sat on Snow's shoulder. The Manemo airport was burning. Everything was burning.

Kiwi brought a baggage cart from the airport. Kiwi sat on top of the many items Calipi and Snow and she brought with them.

Orion woke up, and so did Vega.
