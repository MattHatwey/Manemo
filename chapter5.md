War. It was easy to start, but hard to end.

Distant sirens, an ambulance, or a firetruck. Police cars were driving around. Manemos were running, and screaming. Only the injured ones. The others slept through the sound.

For some reason, nobody could use magic, except for the Bad Manemos.

Until today, everything was fine. It was only a week after Vega and the others came.

Matt woke up and quickly ran toward the security code to the diamond. It was broken. He tried to fix it, but nothing worked. 

Sansei ran towards Matt. So did Hatwey and the others in the crystal tower, besides the children. Matt knew if he fixed the diamond first instead of saving his children, everyone would be saved. When the diamond would not fix, Matt panicked. 

Earon was caught and captured first, then Wisteria, then Ichigo, then Choco, and finally, Rainflower. Hatwey and Honest looked around, searching for safety. 

Suddenly, a Bad Manemo came up to Matt. 

Matt was teleported to a different dimention. Hatwey and Honest cam back to see what happened. Soon Sansei, Honest and Hatwey were also teleported to a different dimention. It was still 3:51AM when they got send to the different dimention.

Kacchan heard the noise and started packing her belongings. She was packing, and thinking. "It they don't make it, what will happen to the memories and pictures that they had?" A tear dropped on her skirt. She collected the most valuable items. Then she started opening the doors of everyone's rooms and shouting: "WAR! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!"

Obsidian quickly packed, and waited outside for Kacchan to come. She had brought everything valuable or something she thought was priceless, like the photo album they had made a few years back.

Obsidian ran to Flame's room, and woke her up. Haru and Kiwi were still asleep. He tried to wake them up, but nothing worked.

They ran as fast as possible, shouting the same thing Kacchan had said to the others.

It was still 4:00AM and nobody really was awake.

Calipi opened her eyes, to see a dark sky, filled with smoke, and ashes, and foggy stars. She saw a lot of fire. She thought of the past. This fire felt nostalgic to her. Although, this was way worse. Calipi ran toward Snow, hugged him, and then shook him until he woke up. Kiwi came to see what happened, and she just stared at the surroundings. They started packing.

Snow was still very tired. It was 5:00AM now. Kiwi just sat on Snow's shoulder. The Manemo airport was burning. Everything was burning.

Kiwi brought a baggage cart from the airport. Kiwi sat on top of the many items Calipi and Snow and she brought with them.

Orion woke up, and so did Vega. Vega started packing all their belongings. Orion tried to wake up the rest of the Manemos sleeping in the Crystal Tower. They didn't wake up. It was still 5AM.

Orion saw Calipi, Snow and Kiwi in near the airport. He quickly grabbed Vega (she was done packing), and ran towards Calipi.

Heather woke up right as Orion and Vega went off to the airport. 

She quickly packed her and Meru and Haru's items, gathered some extra items, grabbed a few snacks, and woke Meru up. He instantly woke up because his favorite girlfriend woke him up. Meru quickly woke Haru up, and piggybacked her. 

Meru shouted at Castor: "Get up. There's a war going on!!!"

Castor bolted up, and gathered his and Meru's guns. "Oh, I almost forgot that one that I borrowed from you." said Meru. He gave the gun to Castor. Castor gave one of Meru's guns that he borrowed back. "Thanks" they said to each other. 

Castor shook Mira awake, and carried her. Mira jumped off, gathered all the items she needed, and got back on Castor's back. She was half-asleep. 

Heather ran towards Mist's room and called. Mist could not hear her. Heather sadly gave up.

The 5 of them ran towards the plains to gather Meru and Castor's fan merch. Then, they ran towards the sea. The docks were all burned down.

Mist woke up. She ran to collect her items, and quickly looked in everyone's room and said: "THERE IS A WAR GOING ON!!! WE NEED TO RUN NOW!!!!!!!!!" Then she ran away, off toward the forest.

Aves woke up. He gathered everything he and Esper and Crystal needed, then woke Esper and Crystal up. They ran toward the mountain range.

Esper and Crystal hugged Aves, and thanked him for waking them up. Aves also hugged them back.

Bubble woke up and so did Sirius. It was 5:30AM now. They gathered snacks, and their belongings. They waited around for a minute or two, but they soon became impatient. They shook Rigel until he woke up, which he did. Rigel carried a few items, then they all ran towards the forest.

Heles and Reverse were next to leave. They packed a few items, looked for anything else they might need, and looked in everyone's rooms. They were last to leave. They stayed in the crystal tower.

It was 6:00AM now.

Meanwhile, Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest were in a weird place. They were in a strange box. Matt was in the grass, Sansei in the ocean, Hatwey was in the snow, and Honest was in the desert.

Matt found a heart in the middle of the grassy area. He touched it, and he felt warm. He saw the broken diamond. He looked at it, and touched it. He was surrounded by warm objects. The diamond spun around, and Matt touched it. Suddenly it became cold again. He was in a cave.

Sansei swam to the bottom of the ocean. She found a glowing star. She touched it. It swam away. It felt warm. She wrapped her arms around it. It stopped moving. She suddenly teleported to a cold cave.

Hatwey walked around in the snow. She saw a glowing star in the twilight sky. She stared at it. Then she jumped, and grabbed the star. She held it tightly in her hands. She also suddenly teleported to a cold cave.

Honest lay down in the sand. He saw a glowing star flying around him. He grasped it. He held it tightly in his arms. He also suddenly teleported to a cold cave.

Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest saw a glowing chest in the cave. They ran toward it, and they opened it. A glowing light pierced through the darkness. Matt saw Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest. So did Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest.

They stared at the cave. Hatwey held the star toward Matt. Sansei and Honest did the same. Matt showed the broken diamond, and the heart. The stars went around the heart, and above the heart was the broken diamond. The heart spun around, and the stars changed shape. One became Peace, another became Fire, and another became Magic. The heart changed to a Snowflake. The diamond and the Snowflake collided. So did the Peace, Fire, and Magic. 

The diamond was fixed. They all touched the diamond, and suddenly, they were back to the real world. Earon and the others waited for them to free them from the cages.

They were lost. The fire was burning everything down. Matt and the others still could not use magic.

Matt and the others saw an army of Bad Manemos running toward them. Matt and the others gave up. 

Suddenly, Legendaria appeared. "I cannot help you. Please do not give up. I believe that you can win." She disappeared.

Matt looked at the sky. So did the others. Then, suddenly, Pattern and Arabelle and the Prince appeared. They used their magic to kill the Bad Manemos. Greenstar and Galaxystar appeared. They also helped to kill the Bad Manemos.

The Bad Manemos were gone. Greenstar and Galaxystar disappeared.

It was now 7:00AM.

Matt looked around. The houses and buildings were all restored. Everything was back to normal. The smoke and fire was gone. The sky was beautiful. It was dawn, but stars were shining brightly. The moon and sun rose. The clouds were pink and yellow. They saw a large pink and yellow cloud with windows. It was like a city. Matt said "Look, It's Kirari-Machi(Shining City)! I call it that.".

Kacchan stared at the sky on the roof of a house. She watched the moment that the houses and buildings were restored. She watched in disbelief. 

Obsidian sat next to her, blankly looking at the sky... 

Flame stared at the sky, and thought of heaven. She smiled.

Calipi looked at the buildings and houses from the now restored airport. She wished her home could be restored like that. She felt sad.

Snow looked at the sky blankly. He was reminded of the pirate and the boat. Then he was reminded of Shirottori-. He smiled, knowing that they were the same Manemo. 

Kiwi looked down at the ground, and saw a sprout grow into a beautiful flower. She looked at it from her teary and blurry eyes. She closed her eyes. She thought Haru would be near the dock. She grew a Kiwi tree near the sea. She smiled through the tears.

Vega stared at the stars. She thought about how scared she used to be, until Orion and the others came. Right when she was thinking about how Orion was there to comfort her even if she ran away, she smiled as she saw the Orion star go near the Vega star. 

Orion looked at Vega, smiling. Orion wished he knew Vega for longer, and wished he remembered what they did. Vega leaned against Orion. Orion pat her on the back.

Heather looked at the sky, and smiled. She felt strange.

Meru stared at everything come to life. He thought it was amazing. He liked it.

Haru looked at her feet. She saw the airport and felt like Kiwi would be there. She grew a flower near the airport. She looked at the ground. She saw a Kiwi plant growing into a tree. She smiled for a second. Then she started to cry silently. Then she looked back at the airport. She smiled through the tears.

Castor stared at everything come to life. He thought it was amazing. He liked it. It felt just like the day he escaped together with Mira and the others.

Mira was looking at everything. She was amazed. She was smiling. Sometimes she would be surprised.

Mist watched the city return to its glory. She was happy that everything was being fixed.

Rigel thought of his life. He laughed at how strange his life was.

Bubble smiled. She looked at Sirius and laughed.

Sirius smiled. She looked at Bubble and laughed.

Aves looked at the beautiful view as the buildings and houses repaired themselves. He smiled, knowing that Leaf would be there tomorrow to greet him.

Esper looked around. He wished his life was better. He wanted his heart to feel fixed, just like the towns and cities. Crystal hugged him and said "I'm happy that I was born with you! I love you!" Esper cried, then smiled.

Crystal watched Esper. Crystal wanted to help because her favorite person was down. Crystal hugged Esper. She said "I'm happy that I was born with you! I love you!". She watched Esper cry and smile.

Heles watched as their house (Crystal Tower) was getting repaired. She smiled. She laughed and said "I'm glad that the houses are fixed!"

Reverse stared at the beautiful constellations. Then, she looked at the sky. She saw the beautiful view and smiled.

The sun rose higher as Matt, Sansei, and the others walked in the town. Good Manemos from all over the place ran towards them.

Haru ran toward the airport. Kiwi ran toward the dock. They couldn't find each other. They looked up at each other. They smiled. They were next to each other the whole time. Calipi looked for Kiwi. Snow ran after Calipi.

Kacchan, Obsidian, and Flame rushed to the Crystal Tower. Bubble and Sirius saw them, and quickly told Mist and Rigel. Mist ran toward the Crystal tower with them. Rigel ran towards Castor and Mira. They ran to the Crystal tower. Soon, Meru was in the race too. Heather ran after Haru.

Crystal smiled at Esper. Esper also smiled. Aves waved at them, then ran to Leaf in the village, waiting for him. Heles watched as Everyone came toward Crystal tower. Orion and Vega walked slowly. Vega smiled. Orion smiled. They blushed.

Every Good Manemo went stood infront the Crystal Tower. Nobody went in.

A bell rang. It was Legendaria, holding a giant bell. 

It was 8:00AM now.

Legendaria appeared. So did Legendarius and Enchendaria.

Legendaria flew on to the sun.

Legendarius flew to the moon. 

Enchendaria smiled, and became Leaf. Aves stared in disbelief. Enchendaria ran to Aves, and whispered "I am the bird docter." Aves grabbed Leaf. Leaf laughed as she escaped easily from the grip of Aves. Enchendaria flew back to the stars. 

Orion waved at Enchendaria. Enchendaria looked at him. Enchendaria grabbed Vega and quickly grabbed Orion. She left Orion and Vega on the stars. Vega smiled. Orion also smiled. Rigel soon arrived. Finally, Castor and Mira also came. 

Enchendaria was the master of disguise. She summoned a clone of herself. The two Enchendarias stared at each other. They touched each other's hand. They became Greenstar and Galaxystar. 

Matt stared at Enchendaria. So did every Manemo. 

Enchendaria smiled, and became a red peekaboo. 

The Peekaboos of color laughed and smiled because they knew their friend was Enchendaria.

Next, Enchendaria looked at Legendaria. Legendaria shook her head (sideways). Enchendaria looked away. 

Legendarius suddenly beamed with joy. Legendarius flew to Enchendaria and told her something. Enchendaria looked and smiled. Enchendaria flew down and caught Pescarudo, who hid away. Pescarudo was Kingdarudo and Queendarudo's child. But she could not use magic. She was teased by. She soon learned to do magic better than anyone, but she kept telling herself she was horrible.

Enchendaria looked at Pescarudo. Pescarudo tried to fly away. Enchendaria caught her. Enchendaria casted a magic spell to make Pescarudo feel good. She soon understood. 

Pescarudo flew into the sky. She shot fireworks in the air follow behind her. She laughed. So did everyone. 

Enchendaria looked back at Legendaria. She nodded (she gave in). Enchendaria fell down and everyone tried to catch her. Enchendaria just floated there. Enchendaria looked at everybody and said:

"Do you know the story of Midnight Gray?"

"No..." said a few. Others started to look sad.

"I will tell you." said Enchendaria.

"July 23rd. About 18:30pm, Greenstar and Galaxystar found a baby bird near a tree. The tree was very tall and her nest would be somewhere very high. She was shivering on the ground but she was not injured. They put her in a small box and brought her back home, since it was getting dark.

The Next Morning.

8:20am, she started chirping very loudly. They put a box on the bushes in the front yard. The baby bird kept chirping so loud. Immediately some birds came to see her with the same loud chirps. They were very cautiously sitting on the edge of the box. And finally the mama bird came into the box to feed the baby bird. The mom bird had come into the box, and the bird was eating some food.

July 25th.
8:50am, Greenstar went to look at the bird but the bird looked like it was dead and he was very sad. Until Galaxystar said that the bird will always live in their heart. " said Enchendaria.

"Her name was Midnight Gray." said Legendaria.

"There used to be a celebration. Until her grave was broken. Nobody knows when that happened. I guess it was the first war." said Legendarius.

Pescarudo raised her one hand and grasped something in the air. She opened her hand. It floated in the air. 

Everyone was surprised.

"I just made it for Midnight Gray." she said, smiling.

"How?" asked Legendaria.

"Beach Glass... Is there something wrong?" asked Pescarudo.

"No..." said Legendaria.

"Actually..." said Legendarius.

"What?" asked Pescarudo.

"Beach Glass are shards of memories. Maybe you collected a single piece of Midnight Gray's memory?" said Legendaria and Legendarius.

Pescarudo smiled. She made more. She tried again. They all worked. There were three. One for Kingdarudo. One for Queendarudo. One for Pescarudo.

"Let us make a grave." said Legendaria.

Everyone started working on the grave. Matt dug, and Sansei brought shovels everytime the shovels would break. Others were planting flowers, adding the stone, bringing beach glass, looking for memories, writing the words, or calling for their kids to help too. They finished 2 hours later, at 10:00AM.

Legendaria smiled. So did everyone else.

F.S. suddenly said "I wish everyone in Kyuusei who died had graves too. I haven't met a single Manemo who was in Kyuusei ever!".

Sansei and Issei looked in shock. Leila laughed. "We are from there." said Arabelle, laughing. Moko Sensei smiled. "Is that you, F.S.?" Moko Sensei said. F.S. smiled back, and said "YES!". Ichigo hugged her. F.S. hugged back. Rui and Dominic stared, happily.

Pescarudo flew up to the skies. Kingdarudo and Queendarudo smiled, then flew up with her. The two had been watching Pescarudo's spectacular performance.

Legendarius sat next to the grave. Legendaria looked up. Enchendaria was playing with the Peekaboos of color.

Pescarudo, Kingdarudo, and Queendarudo flew in a circle, holding hands. They spun faster and faster. They then touched the 3 Beach Glass pieces together. 

The sky glowed and the sun rose higher and higher. The sky was clear with no clouds.

Enchendaria transformed into Midnight Gray. 

"Hello. I am the real Midnight Gray. Thank you for bringing me back to Manemo Land." said Midnight Gray. 

In a second Midnight Gray disappeared. Then she reappeared. Midnight Gray and Enchendaria sat together.

The Manemos watched happily. 

"Should we introduce our selves for the newcomers?" asked Legendaria, looking toward Rigel, then closed her eyes, and smiled. Rigel knew that she knew he wasn't a newcomer, but didn't know anybody.

Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, Honest, Rainflower, Earon, Wisteria, Choco, and Ichigo came first. "We are a team of 9, and we all live in the Crystal Tower."

Next were Matt's children.

A few more introduced themselves.

After that was the members of Easter Land and Harvest Time.

Last was Mira, Castor, Rigel, Vega, and Orion.

This went on for maybe 5 hours, until 3:30PM.

"Should we eat lunch? I'm kinda hungry..." said a few Manemos. Legendaria agreed.

Everyone quickly prepared their own picnic areas. Everyone sat next to each other, talking about news, gossiping, laughing, running around, etc. Crystal quickly prepared Bubble Lake Boba's selling stands. A lot of other Manemos also started setiing up shops. 

"Bake Sale!" said Moko-Sensei, holding a big metal tray of delicious treats. Macarons, Cream Puffs, Breads, Croissants, Sandwiches, Pies, Cupcakes, Normal Cakes, Icing Cookies, Cookies, Marzipan Desserts, and so much more! The Bake Sale soon ended because of the amount of Manemos who wanted the treats. Moko-Sensei soon made more for everyone. The Manemos happily ate, drank, and ran around. 

"Healthy Foods!" said Leaf. Aves came immediatly, and grabbed her.

"Enchendaria. Show me the real Leaf! The Bird Docter." Aves shook her.

Enchendaria stared. She was very surprised.

She found something in her pocket and summoned the real Leaf for the second time ever.

"I still remember all the memories with you while I was Enchendaria." said Leaf, smiling.

Aves smiled, too.

"Healthy Foods!" said Aves and Leaf, smiling. 

Everyone came to eat Salads, Bread, Avocado Toasts, Fruit Salad, and so much more!

Aves invited Leaf to Bubble Lake Boba. The two decided on the same drink. They ordered one drink, and two straws. They drank the Boba Tea together. Right as Leaf was going to dig in her pockets to find money, or anything to give to Crystal, Aves stopped her, and handed Crystal a few coins. Crystal smiled and said "Come again, Aves, and... Leaf!"

Leaf and Aves smiled. Aves started picking up random flowers. "Do you like somebody?" asked Leaf, a little sadly, knowing it wasn't her that he liked. Aves smiled and stared at Leaf. "Yes." Leaf frowned, because she still thought it was not her that he liked. "I'm going to give it to her once I'm done making it." said Aves. 

A few minutes later, Aves finished. "I'm done!". He smiled.

Leaf looked around for any other Manemos, to see who Aves wanted to give the bouquet to.

Aves sat in the marriage proposal posision. Manemos were all around watching who he would give the bouquet to. Aves gently pulled out a beautiful jade ring, and on the gold ring itself, the words were embed, LEAF. Aves gave it to Leaf, and then gave her the bouquets.

"How?" said Leaf. "I always loved you." said Aves. "From that first day when we met, to the times I was talking to Enchendaria. I always, always, loved you more than anything in the world. Leaf was in complete shock. Then she smiled.

Leaf was always a very busy Manemo, so sadly, Leaf was unable to move to Aves and the others. She lived in Cloud City. Aves and the others lived in Sunlight Town. They were pretty far away. But Manemo Land had chat, voicemail, calls, texts, mail, etc.

The parade had already gone for a solid 3 hours. Some went back home, others stayed. It was 6:30PM now.

Some people wanted to stay until the night festival. Others wanted a quick rest before the night festival. But nobody wanted to miss it.

It was now 8:30PM. Manemos who stayed near the area the whole time started preparing the night festival.

Manemos started pouring in at about 8:50PM. A few Manemos arrived earlier.

All the Manemos were there by 9:10PM. The festival was going to start at 9:30PM, but since everyone had already arrived, they started early.

Manemos started eating, playing, running, looking at the sky, etc. Leaf and Aves look at the sky and smile at each other. Some Manemos were selling stuff.

"Blue Peekaboo's Slime! Selling now!!!" 

"Bake sale! Bake sale!"

"We're selling books! New signed books!"

"Selling pencilcases!!!"

Everyone was buying. 

Snow looked down and saw a note on the ground. He picked it up. It was a little scribble of a pirate with wings flying away from a pirate ship. Snow looked around and saw a boy holding the same pack of notes. Snow gave the boy the note. The boy smiled, before saying "Thank you! That was my drawing!" He went running off happily. Snow looked and smiled. 

Suddenly the boy reappeared. "Strange isn't it? Why would I know about Shirottori-?" He said. Snow jumped. "Where did you come from? Who are you?!"

"I guess you don't know either. Nobody does." He made a fake smile. 

"I'm Rigel."

He dissapeared.
