War. It was easy to start, but hard to end.

Distant sirens, an ambulance, or a firetruck. Police cars were driving around. Manemos were running, and screaming. Only the injured ones. The others slept through the sound.

For some reason, nobody could use magic, except for the Bad Manemos.

Until today, everything was fine. It was only a week after Vega and the others came.

Kacchan woke up. 

Kacchan heard the noise and started packing her belongings. She was packing, and thinking. "It they don't make it, what will happen to the memories and pictures that they had?" A tear dropped on her skirt. She collected the most valuable items. Then she started opening the doors of everyone's rooms and shouting: "WAR! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!"

Obsidian quickly packed, and waited outside for Kacchan to come. She had brought everything valuable or something she thought was priceless, like the photo album they had made a few years back.

Obsidian ran to Flame's room, and woke her up. Haru and Kiwi were still asleep. He tried to wake them up, but nothing worked.

They ran as fast as possible, shouting the same thing Kacchan had said to the others.

It was still 4AM and nobody really was awake.

Calipi opened her eyes, to see a dark sky, filled with smoke, and ashes, and foggy stars. She saw a lot of fire. She thought of the past. This fire felt nostalgic to her. Although, this was way worse. Calipi ran toward Snow, hugged him, and then shook him until he woke up. Kiwi came to see what happened, and she just stared at the surroundings. They started packing.

Snow was still very tired. It was 5:00AM now. Kiwi just sat on Snow's shoulder. The Manemo airport was burning. Everything was burning.

Kiwi brought a baggage cart from the airport. Kiwi sat on top of the many items Calipi and Snow and she brought with them.

Orion woke up, and so did Vega. Vega started packing all their belongings. Orion tried to wake up the rest of the Manemos sleeping in the Crystal Tower. They didn't wake up. It was still 5AM.

Orion saw Calipi and Snow and Kiwi in near the airport. He quickly grabbed Vega (she was done packing), and ran towards Calipi.

Heather woke up right as Orion and Vega went off to the airport. 

She quickly packed her and Meru and Haru's items, gathered some extra items, grabbed a few snacks, and woke Meru up. He instantly woke up because his favorite girlfriend woke him up. Meru quickly woke Haru up, and piggybacked her. 

Meru shouted at Castor: "Get up. There's a war going on!!!"

Castor bolted up, and gathered his and Meru's guns. "Oh, I almost forgot that one that I borrowed from you." said Meru. He gave the gun to Castor. Castor gave one of Meru's guns that he borrowed back. "Thanks" they said to each other. 

Castor shook Mira awake, and carried her. Mira jumped off, gathered all the items she needed, and got back on Castor's back. She was half-asleep. 

Heather ran towards Mist's room and called. Mist could not hear her. Heather sadly gave up.

The 5 of them ran towards the plains to gather Meru and Castor's fan merch. Then, they ran towards the sea. The docks were all burned down.

Mist woke up. She ran to collect her items, and quickly looked in everyone's room and said: "THERE IS A WAR GOING ON!!! WE NEED TO RUN NOW!!!!!!!!!" Then she ran away, off toward the forest.

Aves woke up. He gathered everything he and Esper and Crystal needed, then woke Esper and Crystal up. They ran toward the mountain range.

Esper and Crystal hugged Aves, and thanked him for waking them up. Aves also hugged them back.

Bubble woke up and so did Sirius. It was 5:30AM now. They gathered snacks, and their belongings.
