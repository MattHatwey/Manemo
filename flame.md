I woke up. It was a cold day. The leaves were orange or brown. I was the youngest in Matt's family! I get spoiled all the time. My favorite sibling is Kacchan. She told me her real name was Pink! And she knew how to dance really well because she was part of an idol group named Peekaboo IdoLz! She tells me all these secrets to me. I promised to never tell anyone in my family. I also wanted to become an idol someday too.
