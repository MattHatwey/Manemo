Flame

I woke up. It was a cold day. The leaves were orange or brown. I was the youngest in Matt's family! I get spoiled all the time. My favorite sibling is Kacchan and Snow. Snow loved me so much! I think he loved me as much as Calipi. Kacchan told me her real name was Pink! And she knew how to dance really well because she was part of an idol group named Peekaboo IdoLz! She tells me all these secrets to me. I promised to never tell anyone in my family. I also wanted to become an idol someday too.

Snow would be near me when I wanted his help, and he loved to buy me snacks and play with me.

I was once sent to heaven because I was considered a 'mistake'. I did not want to leave Pink and Snow alone. I had kept all of these secrets with them, so I sent a new Manemo named Obsidian. He can hear my voice, he can feel the pain that I feel, but I could also hear his voice, and his pain. We had a connection. Pink liked Obsidian, and so did Snow.

Soon I was sent back to the crystal tower. Luckily, Obsidian hadn't replaced me. Now Pink and Obsidian were married. Snow had me and Obsidian and Kiwi and Calipi now.
