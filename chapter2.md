  Pattern and the mysterious Manemo’s egg was in their house when suddenly a war broke out.
They were scared. The Bad Manemos were gathering around their house. “Pattern, please stay safe. I will go fight.” He never came back. Soon Pattern also was killed, and the egg was buried underground. 

  One day a Manemo was born in the middle of the 1st war of Manemos. If a Manemo is born in the middle of the war, that Manemo will develop the power of the side that won. Matt  got the power of the Bad Manemos. Those rules were made by the ancient scroll of Legedaria and had many important rules so all the Manemos would always listen to the rules, and create them. Everyone would use it, but Matt.
Because he had the power of evil, he couldn't use it.

  He met friends, friends that were not scared of him, friends that could forgive him, best friends forever.
Until one day, a friend said, "Where did you live when you were born?” “I don't know…” said Matt.
“Maybe we could go ask Kingdarudo and Queendarudo to help search in the ancient scroll ”. Said one Manemo from nearby.
“What scroll?” asked Matt, looking confused.
“You don’t know?” Said all the Manemos that were around him.
It was made on the day of the war.” They said.

  That afternoon Matt went to the castle and said to Kingdarudo and Queendarudo; “Will you tell me about the prophercy that was made when I was born?'' asked Matt.
 “You were alone when you were born,” said Kingdarudo.
“Ok.” said Matt.
He asked his friends, “Who won the battle in the war?” said Matt.
“Which war?”
“The war from 6 years ago.
“The evilness.” said one of his friends.
“I was born that day. I can’t use it,'' said Matt.
“Why?” asked one friend.
“Because I have the power to be evil.” said Matt. 

  All manemos were scared of Evilness and the battle.
One day, Matt found out his friends didn’t like him after all.
“Why?” he thought as he was walking.
After he told his friends that he has the power of evil, his friends got scared and ran away. They didn't care about him anymore.
He felt lonely. He lay down and kept on having a dream of an egg he found in the middle of the war and was with the egg and then he thought that the egg was near. He thought for a minute..
Then he knew exactly where it was.

   He found the egg. There was a crack
“Finally.” said Matt.
They were together until he noticed that Kingdarudo and Queendarudo were looking at him.
  But he felt safe.
He rang the bell and Kingdarudo and Queendarudo let him in.

  When he looked at the egg, he felt happy.
  Suddenly, a meteor collided with the land. There were two small Manemos.
Matt asked them to help him, and they said yes.
One Manemo was holding the egg.
  Before, Matt tried to ask his old friends to help, but they didn’t really want to and their boss said “no!” to them, so they didn’t help.
  The King and Queen of the Bad Manemos used to be good Manemos until they were knocked into a volcano by good Manemos. The good Manemos didn’t like the King and Queen and accidentally made them into Bad Manemos. The King and Queen were Hatwey’s mother and father, also known as Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo.
  They killed a lot of good Manemos and somehow turned them into bad manemos.

  Matt used his powers, and the two manemos were surprised and scared.
The two little Manemos hid deeper inside the bush.

  The number of bad manemos got bigger than ever, so large that only a few good manemos were there to help, when a B.A.D member broke the diamond.

  Matt came rushing to the security code to see the diamond broken.
The little Manemos came running to the diamond too.
“No! The diamond!” said Matt
“How do we fix it?” said Matt.
“I don’t know…” said one little Manemo.
  Matt looked at the diamond. Suddenly the diamond started glowing. Then there was a field of magic that surrounded the bad Manemos. The bad Manemos became good Manemos.
  Then the old good Manemos were able to be with their children.
“Mom!” said Matt.
“Matt!” said Pattern.
Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo were there too. The egg was born. 
It was Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo’s egg. They decided to name her Hatwey.

"What's your name?" Matt asked to the little Manemos.
"My name is Honest. I'm Sansei."
"Who are you?" asked Sansei and Honest. "I'm Matt." "And I'm Hatwey!"

  Matt was 12 years old, Hatwey was 0 years old, Honest was 3 years old, and Sansei was 6 years old. 
  The next day, they ventured to the old castle of Infinity when they saw a carriage with a Bad Manemo on it. Her name was Vomit.

                                                         CH.21 Odd and Even

  Vomit was welcomed by Odd, a fat and mean Bad Manemo, and Even, who was a slave.
The castle ruins were very beautiful. Then, Odd said a very important thing.
  “We are interested in making a robot army. We will make the first one. It’s name is N/O/N1394. 
“Thank you, Odd. Even, please get some food for me.
“Yes.” said Even. 
“I saw Manemos right now. Capture them.” said Vomit.
“Run!” said Matt.
                                                         CH.22 別れ

　「マット？」サンセイの声が聞こえます。今どこ？
「サンセイ！気をつけて。」マットが言いました。
「え？？？あああああ！」サンセイが悲鳴をあげました。
「だから言ったでしょ。」マットが言いました。
マット達は、走っていたら、迷子になりました。マットは、一応悪いマニモの血もあるから、悪いマニモが近くにいると、悪いマニモになります。
「マット？何してるの？」サンセイが聞きます。
「捕まえられました。オッド。」マットはサンセイを無視して、オッドに向かって言いました。

                                                         CH.23 Matt and Sansei

  Sansei was locked up by Odd and Matt. She was sad that Matt betrayed her. She was very lonely until the next week.
  “Sansei. I’m sorry. I’ll let you go. I’m a Bad Manemo. Just leave me here. I won’t hurt anybody if you keep me here. Just lock me up.” said Matt.
“But you helped me.” said Sansei.
“So what. I’m a Bad Manemo. Personality doesn't change whether you’re a Bad Manemo or good one. Lock me up already.”
“But-”
“No buts. Lock me up.”
“Personality does change! Please Matt, I don't care if you’re a Bad Manemo or good Manemo!”
“Okay, I’m sorry. Let’s escape before they find us.”
“I’m ready!”
  During that time, Honest and Hatwey were trying to think of a plan to meet up with Matt and Sansei.

                                                         CH.24 Return of the Squad

  Hatwey and Honest were halfway there when Matt and Sansei came running towards them.
“Okay! EVERYONE!!! WE’RE GOING TO MAKE PEACE!!!!”
  All the Manemos heard Matt, and the good Manemos agreed to help restore peace. They thought that it would be a good rule for the prophecy.

                                                         CH.25 Legendaria

  “Thank you everyone.” 
Suddenly all the Manemos heard Legendaria’s voice, and it was.
  “LEGENDARIA???” said all the Manemos.
“Yes. I have come here to say hello to all of you. Thank you for making peace. We know that there will be war from now on…
  Everyone was cheering before Legendaria could finish her sentence.
  Then, suddenly, a second Legendaria was next to her.
“Everyone, this is Legendarius. She is part of me.” said Legendaria.
“I have come…” said Legendarius.
“Me too…” said another voice.
“YAY!!!! LEGENDARIA AND LEGENDARIUS, and who??” 
“Wait… Enchendaria??” said all the Manemos. 
“Yes. said Enchendaria.
  Enchendaria was a legend back when Legendaria was born. When Legendaria met Legendarius, she also thought she saw Enchendaria. Enchendaria was the bird who watched Legendaria Disappear.

                                                         CH.26 Snowflake, Peace, Firewing, and Mystic

  “Matt, can we talk? Also I would like to talk with your friends too.” said Pattern.
“Okay!” said Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest.
“We should make new last names for you all.” said Pattern.
“I don’t know my last name.” said Hatwey and Honest.
“Then let’s make one!” said Pattern.
“Okay!!!” said Matt.
“Snowflake.”
“Me, right??” said Matt. “But why Snowflake?”
“You’ll find out soon.” said Pattern.
“Peace.” said Pattern.
“Me?” said Hatwey, Honest, and Sansei.
“You, Sansei.” said Pattern.
“Why?” said Sansei.
“Firewing.” said Pattern.
“Probably me.” said Hatwey.
“Mystic.” said Pattern.
“Me.” said Honest.

                                                         CH.27 虹の塔

　戦争が終わってから、虹が光っています。マット、サンセイ、ハットウィーとオネストは、虹がどこから来たのか、見ることにしました。
「何これ。クリスタル？」とマットが言いました。
地面に小さなクリスタルが突き刺さっていました。
「そうみたいだね！」とサンセイ、ハットウィーとオネストが言いました。
「あれ？」マットが言いました。
「うわあー」とみんなが言いました。
　他のマニモも来てます。
　急に、地面に刺さっていたクリスタルが大きくなり、タワーの形になり、光っていました。

                                                         CH.28 Mirror

  The Crystal Tower was big enough to fit more than 100 Manemos. Suddenly, all the Manemos thought this tower was made because Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest made peace again. They were very happy that the war was over.
  “Let’s go inside. It’s probably our castle.” said Matt.
“Yeah!” said Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest.
The castle already had all of the interior in place.
10 pots, 3 carpets, 12 rooms, a dining room, a living room, 2 bathrooms, 2 kitchens, and a mirror.
  But this mirror wasn’t just a mirror. It was shining and looked magical.

                                                         CH.29 The Magic of Manemos

Manemos have never used magic. Only Legendaria could, but after she disappeared she could not use magic. The Manemos thought magic was only for Legendaria, and now that she doesn’t have magic, they thought that the Bad Manemos must have stolen it.
  Matt felt as though he could feel magic inside of the castle. He felt like he had magic in him.
He knew magic still existed. Not only the Bad Manemos, but good Manemos too. 

                                                         CH.30 Manemo Land

  Uranus never had a name. Until this point, it was called the land of the Manemos. 
  Matt knew this was land for good Manemos, so he needed to think of a name for each area so Manemos could tell the difference between Bad Manemo territory, and good Manemo territory. 
  Matt decided to name the good Manemos’ land to Solitude Nation, and the Bad Manemos’ land to Badland Territory.

                                                         CH.31 Magical Adventure

  Matt, Sansei, Honest, and Hatwey had been living in the Crystal Tower for 2 years.
Matt was 15, Sansei was 8, Hatwey was 2, and Honest was 5 years old.
  They wanted to explore Manemo Land, so they decided to.

                                                         CH.32 チョコちゃんとイチゴちゃん

　マット達が冒険を始めた１時間後には、誰もいませんでした。
「もう暗いし、寝よう。」マットが言いました。
「うん。」サンセイ、オネストとハットウィーが言いました。
「チョコ？どこ行ったのかな？」と声が聞こえました。
「ここだよ、イチゴ！」また声が聞こえました。
「誰？」サンセイはびっくりして、飛び上がりました。
「チョコー。誰かがいるよ〜〜〜！」声がまたきこえました。
　マット、オネストとハットウィーも起き上がりました。
「私はチョコです。この子はイチゴ。迷子になったの。助けてくれる？」
「チョコちゃんとイチゴちゃんはどこから来たの？」マットが聞きました。
「チョコ？」ハットウィーが言いました。
「ハットウィー？」チョコちゃんが言いました。
「イチゴ？？？」サンセイが言いました。
「誰？もしかして、レイラの兄弟？？？似てる。」イチゴちゃんが言いました。
「レイラ知ってるの？」サンセイが言いました。
　その時、急に、サンセイが昔のことを思い出しました。
「ちょっと待って。」と言って、サンセイは1分黙っていました。
その間、他のみんなも黙っていました。
                                                         CH.33 知合

　「やっぱり」とサンセイが言いました。
「うん。」とイチゴちゃんが言いました。
　「マットってパターンの子供？」とサンセイが聞きました。
「うん。」とマットが答えました。
「アラベールっていう名前のマニモ知ってる？」とサンセイが聞きました。
「うん、知ってるよ。パターンの友達。」とマットが言いました。
「アラベールって知ってる。」イチゴちゃんも言いました。
「レイラのまま。」サンセイが言いました。
「一生とレイラとサンセイのまま。」イチゴちゃんが言いました。
「イチゴおばさんは？」イチゴちゃんが聞きました。
「知ってる。ままの九星の友達。」とサンセイが答えました。
　サンセイとイチゴちゃんは30分も話していました。
　「ハットウィー。」チョコちゃんがまた言いました。
「チョコ。」ハットウィーが言いました。
「君達も兄弟？」サンセイ、マット、オネストとイチゴちゃんが聞きました。
「うん。」とハットウィーとチョコちゃんが答えました。
　「ハットウィーって、キングダルドとクイーンダルドの前にマニモランドをコントロールしてたマニモの子供だよね。」マットが言いました。

                                                         CH.34 The Grassland Region’s Manemo 

  “It’s so comfortable here.” said Matt.
“It’s just grass here.” said Sansei.
“Yeah.” said Matt.
“The Grassland Region?” said Matt.
  Suddenly, Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest saw a Manemo.
“Who are you?” said the Manemo.
“I’m Matt, this is Sansei, Honest, and Hatwey.
“I’m Rainflower. I was born here. I’m 6 years old.” said Rainflower.

                                                         CH.35 Journey to Crystal Tower

  Matt, Sansei, Honest, and Hatwey had been adventuring for 1 month.
“We should go back to Crystal Tower. It’s been a long time since we were there and I think it’ll take more than a week to get back home.” said Sansei and Hatwey.
“Good Idea. Do you want to come with us, Rainflower, Ichigo, Choco?” said Matt.
“Do we have enough food for that? We’re already running out of food.” said Honest.
“I think Rainflower may have a plan…” said Matt.
“I’m coming back.” said Rainflower.
“Okay!” said Ichigo and Choco.
  Right before the sun set, Rainflower came back with a ton of fruits.
  “Crystalite Berries, Budding Amethyst Shards, Moon Shards, Cloudberries, and Cotton Fruit.” said Rainflower.
“I knew you could bring the food.” said Matt.
“How?” asked Sansei.
“Rainflower lives here.” said Matt.
“Yes.” said Rainflower.
“Let’s eat!” said Honest and Choco.
“Yeah!” said the others.
“After we eat, we should start on our journey back home. It’s almost dark, but I think traveling during the night is easier. We probably won’t see any Bad Manemos.” said Matt.
“Yeah. I don’t want to meet any Bad Manemo on the way back.” said Ichigo.
  Once they finished eating and started their journey, it was very dark and cold.

                                                         CH.36 Arrival

  As the sun started to rise, Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, Honest, Ichigo, Choco, and Rainflower saw the Solitude Nation.
  “Matt!!!” said one Manemo.
“Who are the other Manemos?” asked another Manemo.
“I’m Rainflower.” 
“I’m Ichigo!”
“I’m Choco!”
“I’m from Kyuusei, same as Sansei.” said Ichigo.
“I’m the sister of Hatwey!” said Choco.
  “And who are you?” asked Honest.
“Who, me?” said the Manemo.
“Yeah. The one who said “Matt!!!” Earlier.” said Honest.
“That’s me.” said the Manemo.
“My name is Sayo.” said the Manemo.
“And I’m Lightning Star! The one who asked “Who are the other Manemos!” After Sayo!” said the other Manemo.

                                                         CH.37 F.S と類

　マット達が、クリスタルタワーに戻ろうとしたら、マニモの話し声が聞こえました。
「私、まだマット達に挨拶してないんだー。君は？」と聞こえました。
「僕もまだしてない。」とまた聞こえました。
「二人とも、僕はここにいるよ！」マットが二人に話しかけました。
「え？」二人が言いました。
「僕に挨拶がしたかったの？」マットが聞きました。
「マット達って言ったじゃん。」サンセイが急に言いました。
「ごめんごめん。」マットが言いました。
「僕は類。」
「私はF.S。」
「そうなんだー。よろしくね！」マットが言いました。
「この子好き。」レインフラワーがF.Sを指で刺しながら言いました。
「ありがとう！」F.Sが答えました。
「この子達すごく可愛い。」マットが言いました。

                                                         CH.38 New Generation

  Matt, Sansei, Honest, Hatwey, Ichigo, Choco, and Rainflower all lived in the Crystal Tower until one day.
“Matt, you will be our Emperor.” said Kingdarudo.
“Sansei, you will be our Empress.” said Queendarudo.
“We will still be Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, but Hatwey and Honest are going to become the New King and New Queen of Manemo Land.” said Kingdarudo and Queendarudo.
“Choco and Ichigo will rule the Candy Land.” said Kingdarudo and Queendarudo.
“Rainflower, you will live in the Animal Nation.” said Kingdarudo and Queendarudo.
  Everyone was cheering until suddenly next to Ichigo and Choco were two Manemos.
“I’m Wisteria.” said one.
“I’m Earon.” said another.
“And Wisteria and Earon will live in the Tower of Two Sisters.” said Kingdarudo and Queendarudo.
  “How about me?” said a voice.
There was a prince, a very small prince. He had a crown and cape, and there was a baby Manemo next to him.
  “Prince?” said Kingdarudo.
“Are you the real Prince?” said Queendarudo.
“Yes. I have been living in the Ancient Forest.” said the Prince.
“Would you like to live here?” said Queendarudo.
“Yes.” said the Prince. 
“Then you can also live in the Crystal Tower.” said Kingdarudo.
