"...Where do you want to live?" said Matt.

"...I would like to go to Neptune." said Rainflower.

"...Why?"

"...I like it here, but I love animals and nature."

"...This place has nature too-"

"...Good morning..." said Sansei.
"You're finally awake!" said Matt.
"What do you mean? It's 6:00AM right now." said Sansei.
"I want to ask you a question." said Rainflower.

"I think you should go where you want to live." said Sansei. "But why do you want to live on Neptune?" said Matt and Sansei.

"I want to restore Neptune to what it used to be." said Rainflower.
"The atmosphere became toxic, so how would you restore it?" asked Matt.
"Please come with me so we could restore Neptune!" said Rainflower.
"But how do we restore it?" said Matt.

At this point, everyone who lived in the crystal tower had come to see what was going on.

"We all don't know how to use magic." said Matt. Everyone was nodding.
"Let's try to learn how to use magic!" said Rainflower.
"That's a great idea!" said everyone.

Everyone besides the prince decided to go back to the Grassland Region again to learn how to use magic without harming any other Manemos who lived in the village.

"Who would like to go first?" asked Sansei.
"How about oldest first and youngest last?" said Matt.
"Sounds good!" said everyone.
"That means me first!" said Matt.
"I always wondered why Pattern called me Snowflake Matt." said Matt.
Matt could feel the magic inside of him.
"I feel the magic!!!" said Matt.

But Matt could not do the simplest form of magic.

"Aww, I felt the magic though." said Matt.
"Me next!" said Sansei.

Sansei could not do the simplest form of magic either.

3 hours had passed, and nobody was able to do the simplest form of magic.

"I hope we can do magic again tomorrow." said Choco and Hatwey.
"Yes." said Ichigo and Sansei.

Everyone felt sad that they couldn't do any magic.
It was getting dark, so everyone wanted to go home.
"Dusk is the worst time to walk around in plain sight. bad Manemos don't like the dark, so they run back home before it becomes night." said Matt.
"But we want to go back NOW!!!" said everyone.

Matt saw bad Manemos in the corner of his eye.

"...Shh. They're coming." said Matt.

"Thought you could hide from us?" said Odd.
"We brought something special that could find you in seconds. Let me introduce you to N/O/N1394 and the other robot Manemos." said Odd.
"You all were doing magic class? Well I'm just going to take all that magic!!!" said all the robots.

Matt and the others could not feel anything though.

"WHY IS THERE NO MAGIC COMING OUT???" said Odd, getting angrier and angrier.
"Maybe it is because they do not have any magic." said N/O/N1394.
"Get ready to go back to prison!" said Odd.

Matt was trying to cut the rope that the robots tied them onto.

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" said Odd. Odd pressed a button on N/O/N1394.
Suddenly, so many robots were summoned that Matt couldn't even count how many there were.
All the robots were pointing lazers at Matt and the others.
"I'm sorry Sansei, Hatwey, Honest, Rainflower, Ichigo, Choco, Earon, Wisteria." said Matt, crying.
Everyone else was also crying.

"GET READY TO FIGHT!" said Odd.

Matt closed his eyes. So did the others.

Matt suddenly heard a voice that nobody else could hear.

"...Matt, use your magic, you have magic still inside of you... Snowflake..."

"We can do this." said Matt.
"Can we really...?" said the others.
"Yes we can!!!" said Matt.
Matt started floating in the air, and grew wings. So did the others.

The sky turned dark, and a blizzard had begun. Then, half of the robots were turned to rocks. The robots were all shot by strawberry seeds, and a gust of wind started blowing around N/O/N1394. The other half of the robots were surrounded by wisteria and could not escape. After that, a large fire started, and some dark chocolate was melting, and it became so hot that the chocolate burned some of the robots surrounded by wisteria. Suddenly the grass that was burnt started growing into poison ivy, which made Odd itch all over, and finally, a magic spell was cast into the grounds, and all of the robots and N/O/N1394 blew up in the sky like fireworks.

"Wait, HOW?" said Odd.

Everyone ignored Odd and walked away.
Odd ran away into the dark.

"WE DID IT!!!" said everyone.
"Did you see me?" said Matt.
"Yeah! That blizzard was pretty cool!" said Honest.
"Your firework show was cool too!" said Matt.
"Look at me!" said Wisteria.
"Me too!!!" said everyone.

Everyone was having a good time.

"We should go back now. It's already dark now." said Matt.
"Oh no. I forgot to bring the lamp." said Sansei.
"Did anyone else bring a lamp?" asked Earon.
"No." said everyone.
"Wait, I have an idea!" said Hatwey.
Honest made a replica of a stick, and Hatwey added an ember to the stick.
"Look!" said Hatwey.
"Amazing!" said Ichigo and Choco.
"Wow" said Rainflower.

That night, everyone slept very well.

"Good morning!" said Matt. "Matt, don't talk while eating your toast!" said Sansei. "Sansei, I want toast too!!!" said Hatwey. "Me too!" said Honest. "How about us?" said the others.

Everyone in town was talking about last night's adventure because Hatwey told the story in the morning to the prince, and the prince told it to Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, which told it to everyone in town.

"Let's try to learn other magic!" said Matt. "Okay!" said everyone. "Let's do this!" said everyone, including Matt.

"Have fun! See you later! I hope you can learn magic! Are there going to be more bad Manemos?" said all the people who lived in the town. Prince was also waving.

"Who wants to go first?" said Matt.
"What if we split into different groups?" said Earon.
"Okay!" said the others.

The teams were team Matt and Sansei, team Hatwey, Honest, Rainflower, team Ichigo and Choco, team Wisteria and Earon.
"Okay, now that we've split into groups, let's split up into different areas of the grassland region! And three hours later, come back to this spot. Rainflower made a patch of sunflowers right here." said Matt.
Everyone did as they were told.

"Is everyone here?" asked Matt.
"Yes!" said everyone.
"Did anyone learn something new?" said Matt.
"Yeah!" said everyone.
"From oldest to youngest." said Matt.
"Okay!" said everyone.
"Me first!" said Matt.

"I learned freeze and icicle. Icicle summons icicles that are as pointy as a spear, and drops them on enimies! And freeze just freezes the opponent." said Matt.

"I learned peace and statue. We can use peace when there is a fight between Manemos, but we don't want to attack them. Statue turns a Manemo into stone, but heals them inside of the stone. They can get out whenever they want." said Sansei.

"I learned ashes and lava. Ashes makes it so that the enemies can only smell ashes, and because they are scared of fire and everything else in the world, they run away from where they can smell the ashes. Lava summons a miny volcano that you can put on anything and it will blow up whenever it detects an enemy." said Hatwey.

"I learned mimic and repair. Mimic can mimic any spell of magic, but the attack is lowered by 50%. Repair can repair your items such as my wand, but you can't use them while you repair them." said Honest.

This conversation went on for 4 hours, and I don't want you to get bored of this story and I don't want to write all of this so I will cut it out.

"I'm so hungry. What time is i- ALREADY 2PM??? said Hatwey.
"How?!" said everyone.
"Well, then we should go back home now." said Matt.
"Okay!" said everyone.

Luckily, Matt and the others did not meet any bad Manemos on the way back either.

"Matt and the others are back!" "Welcome back!" said all the Manemos in town.
"Did you have fun?" said the prince.
"Yeah!" said Matt and the others.
"Hello, Matt." said Queendarudo and Kingdarudo.
"Hi!" said Matt.
"Hatwey, your parents are also coming in a little bit." said Queendarudo.
"Yay!" said Hatwey.
"Also, Arabelle has come back!" said Kingdarudo.
"Sansei! It's so good to see you." said Arabelle.
"I missed you. Are you going to live here?" said Sansei.
"I will live here from now on." said Arabelle.
"Hello!" said Leila and Issei.
"Hello!" said Sansei.
"Please come the crystal tower. There is a strange thing going on." said the prince.
"Okay." said Matt and the others.

"...What is it?" said Matt and the others.
"It's the mirror." said the prince.
"It looks like there is another dimetion inside of the mirror." said Matt.
"But nobody can get inside of it." said the prince.

"Let me try!" said Hatwey.

But it did not work.
"I'll try next!" said Matt.
He tried putting his hand inside of the mirror, and then Matt suddenly disappeared.
"What just happened?!" said everyone.

"...Where is this?" said Matt.
He looked around but he saw nothing.
Until suddenly, he saw something.
It was a circle, floating like a bubble.
"...What is that? Is it a memory?" said Matt.
Then he saw a picture inside of the bubble.
It was a picture of a Manemo.
Matt decided to try to look closer, and he touched it.
"...What is going on-" said Matt.

"..."

"...Could that memory be in the future?" said Matt.
