"...Where do you want to live?" said Matt.

"...I would like to go to Neptune." said Rainflower.

"...Why?"

"...I like it here, but I love animals and nature."

"...This place has nature too-"

"...Good morning..." said Sansei.
"You're finally awake!" said Matt.
"What do you mean? It's 6:00AM right now." said Sansei.
"I want to ask you a question." said Rainflower.

"I think you should go where you want to live." said Sansei. "But why do you want to live on Neptune?" said Matt and Sansei.

"I want to restore Neptune to what it used to be." said Rainflower.
"The atmosphere became toxic, so how would you restore it?" asked Matt.
"Please come with me so we could restore Neptune!" said Rainflower.
"But how do we restore it?" said Matt.

At this point, everyone who lived in the crystal tower had come to see what was going on.

"We all don't know how to use magic." said Matt. Everyone was nodding.
"Let's try to learn how to use magic!" said Rainflower.
"That's a great idea!" said everyone.

Everyone besides the prince decided to go back to the Grassland Region again to learn how to use magic without harming any other Manemos who lived in the village.

"Who would like to go first?" asked Sansei.
"How about oldest first and youngest last?" said Matt.
"Sounds good!" said everyone.
"That means me first!" said Matt.
"I always wondered why Pattern called me Snowflake Matt." said Matt.
Matt could feel the magic inside of him.
"I feel the magic!!!" said Matt.

But Matt could not do the simplest form of magic.

"Aww, I felt the magic though." said Matt.
"Me next!" said Sansei.

Sansei could not do the simplest form of magic either.

3 hours had passed, and nobody was able to do the simplest form of magic.

"I hope we can do magic again tomorrow." said Choco and Hatwey.
"Yes." said Ichigo and Sansei.

Everyone felt sad that they couldn't do any magic.
It was getting dark, so everyone wanted to go home.
"Dusk is the worst time to walk around in plain sight. bad Manemos don't like the dark, so they run back home before it becomes night." said Matt.
"But we want to go back NOW!!!" said everyone.

Matt saw bad Manemos in the corner of his eye.

"...Shh. They're coming." said Matt.

"Thought you could hide from us?" said Odd.
"We brought something special that could find you in seconds. Let me introduce you to N/O/N1394 and the other robot Manemos." said Odd.
"You all were doing magic class? Well I'm just going to take all that magic!!!" said all the robots.

Matt and the others could not feel anything though.

"WHY IS THERE NO MAGIC COMING OUT???" said Odd, getting angrier and angrier.
"Maybe it is because they do not have any magic." said N/O/N1394.
"Get ready to go back to prison!" said Odd.

Matt was trying to cut the rope that the robots tied them onto.

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" said Odd. Odd pressed a button on N/O/N1394.
Suddenly, so many robots were summoned that Matt couldn't even count how many there were.
All the robots were pointing lazers at Matt and the others.
"I'm sorry Sansei, Hatwey, Honest, Rainflower, Ichigo, Choco, Earon, Wisteria." said Matt, crying.
Everyone else was also crying.

"GET READY TO FIGHT!" said Odd.

Matt closed his eyes. So did the others.

Matt suddenly heard a voice that nobody else could hear.

"...Matt, use your magic, you have magic still inside of you... Snowflake..."

"We can do this." said Matt.
"Can we really...?" said the others.
"Yes we can!!!" said Matt.
Matt started floating in the air, and grew wings. So did the others.

The sky turned dark, and a blizzard had begun. Then, half of the robots were turned to rocks. The robots were all shot by strawberry seeds, and a gust of wind started blowing around N/O/N1394. The other half of the robots were surrounded by wisteria and could not escape. After that, a large fire started, and some dark chocolate was melting, and it became so hot that the chocolate burned some of the robots surrounded by wisteria. Suddenly the grass that was burnt started growing into poison ivy, which made Odd itch all over, and finally, a magic spell was cast into the grounds, and all of the robots and N/O/N1394 blew up in the sky like fireworks.

"Wait, HOW?" said Odd.

Everyone ignored Odd and walked away.
Odd ran away into the dark.

"WE DID IT!!!" said everyone.
"Did you see me?" said Matt.
"Yeah! That blizzard was pretty cool!" said Honest.
"Your firework show was cool too!" said Matt.
"Look at me!" said Wisteria.
"Me too!!!" said everyone.

Everyone was having a good time.

"We should go back now. It's already dark now." said Matt.
"Oh no. I forgot to bring the lamp." said Sansei.
"Did anyone else bring a lamp?" asked Earon.
"No." said everyone.
"Wait, I have an idea!" said Hatwey.
Honest made a replica of a stick, and Hatwey added an ember to the stick.
"Look!" said Hatwey.
"Amazing!" said Ichigo and Choco.
"Wow" said Rainflower.

That night, everyone slept very well.

"Good morning!" said Matt. "Matt, don't talk while eating your toast!" said Sansei. "Sansei, I want toast too!!!" said Hatwey. "Me too!" said Honest. "How about us?" said the others.

Everyone in town was talking about last night's adventure because Hatwey told the story in the morning to the prince, and the prince told it to Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, which told it to everyone in town.

"Let's try to learn other magic!" said Matt. "Okay!" said everyone. "Let's do this!" said everyone, including Matt.

"Have fun! See you later! I hope you can learn magic! Are there going to be more bad Manemos?" said all the people who lived in the town. Prince was also waving.

"Who wants to go first?" said Matt.
"What if we split into different groups?" said Earon.
"Okay!" said the others.

The teams were team Matt and Sansei, team Hatwey, Honest, Rainflower, team Ichigo and Choco, team Wisteria and Earon.
"Okay, now that we've split into groups, let's split up into different areas of the grassland region! And three hours later, come back to this spot. Rainflower made a patch of sunflowers right here." said Matt.
Everyone did as they were told.

"Is everyone here?" asked Matt.
"Yes!" said everyone.
"Did anyone learn something new?" said Matt.
"Yeah!" said everyone.
"From oldest to youngest." said Matt.
"Okay!" said everyone.
"Me first!" said Matt.

"I learned freeze and icicle. Icicle summons icicles that are as pointy as a spear, and drops them on enimies! And freeze just freezes the opponent." said Matt.

"I learned peace and statue. We can use peace when there is a fight between Manemos, but we don't want to attack them. Statue turns a Manemo into stone, but heals them inside of the stone. They can get out whenever they want." said Sansei.

"I learned ashes and lava. Ashes makes it so that the enemies can only smell ashes, and because they are scared of fire and everything else in the world, they run away from where they can smell the ashes. Lava summons a miny volcano that you can put on anything and it will blow up whenever it detects an enemy." said Hatwey.

"I learned mimic and repair. Mimic can mimic any spell of magic, but the attack is lowered by 50%. Repair can repair your items such as my wand, but you can't use them while you repair them." said Honest.

This conversation went on for 4 hours, and I don't want you to get bored of this story and I don't want to write all of this so I will cut it out.

"I'm so hungry. What time is i- ALREADY 2PM??? said Hatwey.
"How?!" said everyone.
"Well, then we should go back home now." said Matt.
"Okay!" said everyone.

Luckily, Matt and the others did not meet any bad Manemos on the way back either.

"Matt and the others are back!" "Welcome back!" said all the Manemos in town.
"Did you have fun?" said the prince.
"Yeah!" said Matt and the others.
"Hello, Matt." said Queendarudo and Kingdarudo.
"Hi!" said Matt.
"Hatwey, your parents are also coming in a little bit." said Queendarudo.
"Yay!" said Hatwey.
"Also, Arabelle has come back!" said Kingdarudo.
"Sansei! It's so good to see you." said Arabelle.
"I missed you. Are you going to live here?" said Sansei.
"I will live here from now on." said Arabelle.
"Hello!" said Leila and Issei.
"Hello!" said Sansei.
"Please come the crystal tower. There is a strange thing going on." said the prince.
"Okay." said Matt and the others.

"...What is it?" said Matt and the others.
"It's the mirror." said the prince.
"It looks like there is another dimetion inside of the mirror." said Matt.
"But nobody can get inside of it." said the prince.

"Let me try!" said Hatwey.

But it did not work.
"I'll try next!" said Matt.
He tried putting his hand inside of the mirror, and then Matt suddenly disappeared.
"What just happened?!" said everyone.

"...Where is this?" said Matt.
He looked around but he saw nothing.
Until suddenly, he saw something.
It was a circle, floating like a bubble.
"...What is that? Is it a memory?" said Matt.
Then he saw a picture inside of the bubble.
It was a picture of a Manemo.
Matt decided to try to look closer, and he touched it.
"...What is going on-" said Matt.

"..."

"...Could that memory be in the future?" said Matt.
"...Let me try another memory." said Matt.

Before Matt could enter another memory, a book suddenly fell from above.

"What's this? Legendaria's book...?" said Matt.

"Legendaria's Book"

I was born on May 12th. My name is Legendaria. I believe that I am the last human born. I do not have any parents.

I felt like I was not a kid. I felt like an adult. I thought I looked weird. I guess all the humans here are weird. But one day, I found a note on the ground and picked it up. It said 'I want to create Manemo.' But what is Manemo? I thought. I am the last human, and I don't care if this generation ends, but I would like to create a new generation of humans.

There were other kids, and I went to school. I liked to stare at the sky during recess, and think for hours and hours, even forgetting to go back to class.

Suddenly I heard a voice. "...Let us go to heaven." "But if I go to heaven, what would happen to everyone else?" "I do not know, let us go to heaven."

On that day, the world ended. They all died because of a desease.

Manemo was created.

I woke up. Nobody was around. Just me. Was this what the note was talking about? Is this a dream? From this day, humans did not exist, nor the belongings of humans. Only the note and the note's dream remained.

Suddenly there was a crystal that was shining brightly. It got brighter and brighter.

??? Years Later

I decided to try to find that voice. It felt like the voice was inside of me. One day I met her. Her name was Legendarius.

??? Years Later

I had disappeared long ago. But Manemo Land remained. Legendaria was worshipped by all the Manemos. Sometimes, I would apppear to see Manemo Land. Right now, Matt, Sansei, Honest, Hatwey, Ichigo, Choco, Wisteria, Earon, and Rainflower were alive. Long ago, I found a library named Heaven God Spirit Library, and I would always read books in the library, or sit down and relax. I loved the library, so I decided to work there to clean the library.

One day when I was cleaning, I found a very dirty book. I tried to open it, but it was locked. I tried breaking the lock with a rock, and it worked. But there was nothing in the book. Until suddenly, the book wrote 'Legendaria's Book'. I had already written this book, and that was my life, so I decided to write a fictional book.

Every day, I wrote in the book. 25 years later, I finished writing it.

"...That's it?" said Matt.

"...I need to find Legendaria's fictional book too." said Matt.

"...This time the story from this book was in the past, but then goes to the future. The library that Legendaria went to was only created 5 years ago. That means Legendaria's Book was created 20 years from now. It might be inside of this mirror. Let me explore more." said Matt.

Matt went further away from the memories, but some of them were following after him.

"...These must be important." said Matt.

"...Let me try this one first." said Matt.

Matt put his hand inside of it, and he teleported to the next memory.

"...I read a book named 'Legendaria's Book'. I am a Manemo from the future. We believe that Legendaria is the 'start' of Manemo. I also read of the ancient story of Matt and the others, along with the story of Masa."

"Return"

I was walking back to home one day, and it started raining. I saw a girl with a bike go past me. She was about to go through the puddle that was created by the rain. Luckily, in Manemo Land, there is a bike lane and a walking lane. I also saw a boy waving at his little brother. He was probably going to buy food for dinner. Suddenly the girl who was riding her bike noticed something on her bike. While she was trying to fix it, she leaned forward so much that she fell into the puddle. "Are you okay?" I asked. She nodded. The boy just stared at us. I helped the girl get up, but she suddenly pointed towards the bike. The bike was coming toward us. The boy came running to us, but the bike was about to hit the girl. We were both too scared to get up. Just as I thought I was going to get hit by the bike, the boy stopped the bike. "Are you two okay?" asked the boy. "Thank you!" said the girl and I. The boy suddenly winked at us. "You go to Manemo International, right? Nice to meet you!" said the boy. "Yeah!" said the girl and I.

The next day

I walked towards my school and I saw the boy. "Good Morning!" said the boy. "Good Morning" said I. The boy walked toward the classrooms. I did not have any friends until now, and usually I look at the ground, but today, I looked around me. There were many classrooms and many Manemos. He opened the door to our classroom. When we opened the door, there was one girl who was sleeping in the classroom. She woke up and said "Good Morning! You're the girl and the boy from yesterday, right?" "Yeah! And Good Morning" said the boy. Good Morning to you too." said I. "What are your names, anyway?" said the boy. "I'm Akira, but call me Sumida." said Sumida. "I'm Kiki!" said Kiki. "I am Suzu. said I. "I'll call you Aki-chan and you are Suzu-chi" said Kiki. Sumida was really kind, and always helping others. Kiki is always excited and always said extra things. "And you're the quiet kid!" said Kiki. "I have a little brother that is very cute and exctied." said Sumida. "I have a little sister too." said I. "Is your lil sis annoying?" said Kiki. "No, not at all." said I. Suddenly we heard a very loud noise. "I think all the Manemos are coming. Put your backpacks in the cubbies." said Sumida. We were just in time. The moment the door burst open, it became really crowded. Sumida's advice helped.

"Lunch Break!" said the teacher. Everyone went running toward the lunch tables. Sumida and Kiki and I decided to eat in the classroom because Kiki wanted to talk about something. "What did you want to talk about?" I asked. "You know how our classroom is only one floor below the rooftop? Have you ever realized that the rooftops are always closed since 3 years ago? It's not because someone fell off the rooftop as we're told, it's because there are cases of bad Manemos randomly appearing there. The next class is magic class, and now is the chance to learn magic." said Kiki. "I think we should learn to fly first." said Sumida. "I already know how to fly." said Kiki. "I know basic fighting skills." said Sumida. "Can you do anything?" asked Kiki. "I don't know magic that well, and I can only use this book for magic." said I. "Okay." said Kiki. "Let's do this!" said Sumida and Kiki and I. 

After magic class was over, we went to math class. And after that, it was recess. "Let's go!" said Kiki. Kiki went to the rooftop by flying out of the window. Sumida climbed up the emergency ladder outside of the window. And I got helped by Kiki. "Thanks Kiki." "How else would you have come to the rooftop?" said Kiki. "We made it!" said Sumida.

"...Get ready to die!" said a bad Manemo.

"Oh no." said Kiki. "There's three of them." said Sumida. "One bad Manemo each." said I. Kiki confused the bad Manemo by flying around the bad Manemo very fast. Sumida knocked the second Manemo off the rooftop. Kiki and Sumida both looked concered because the bad Manemo I was facing was big, and also because my magic is not the most powerful thing in the world. "I will call you when I need your help." said I. I got my book out and started to say the words. There was a very bright aura around me, but I did not feel any magic, and I couldn't see that well because of the bright aura. "I think I need help." said I. "Okay!" said Sumida and Kiki. But before they could come to help, I suddenly felt magic and I started glowing even more. Sumida and Kiki backed away because they did not want to get beaten up by the magic spell. Sumida, Kiki, and I felt a gust of magic that was headed straight towards the bad Manemo, and the moment the magic (now it looked more like a meteor) touched the bad Manemo, we closed our eyes because the magic was too strong and too bright. 

When we opened our eyes, we were in a completely different place. We were still on the rooftop, but there were tons of Manemos congratulating us. There were also many different kinds of flowers everywhere. Sumida and Kiki thanked me for defeating the biggest bad Manemo and were sorry that they doubted me. But I had one problem. When the aura became so bright that I couldn't see, I had lost my book. But I ended up using a magic spell that was not in the book, and without the book either. Maybe I had learned how to cast spells without a book. "Thank you everyone for coming!" said Kiki. "I don't know where you all came from though!" said Kiki and Sumida and I. I also noticed and told Kiki and Sumida that there was a staircase near where we came from. "Since there are lots of flowers and plants around here, I will launch a few flower fireworks." said I. Kiki and Sumida were watching me excitedly. I felt the magic inside of me, and when I released the magic, there was a single flower firework. And then I did it again, and again. I was actually having fun for the first time in my life!

And that was how magic returned me to what I used to be. A Manemo who loved magic and had fun everyday. But now, I know how to use that magic.

"...Let me try this one next." said Matt.
