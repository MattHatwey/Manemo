Haru

I woke up in a room, and I saw a beautiful sky outside the window. The sky was clear, and many flowers were growing. 

My parents, Heather and Meru, have a very strange relationship. I like them both very much. They are kind to me all the time. Unlike Heather, I am not a crazy fan of Meru. I like him as a dad, but not as some weirdo who dances in the middle of nowhere, attracting girls.

I also like Snow and Calipi's kid, Kiwi. I'm aware that I don't show my feelings as much as Meru. But I think Kiwi knows, and I think she also likes me.
