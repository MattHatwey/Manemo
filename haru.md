Haru

I woke up in a room, and I saw a beautiful sky outside the window. The sky was clear, and many flowers were growing. My brother and sister, Meru and Heather, say that they are my parents. I do sometimes think why I usually stay in Heather and Meru's new house, but I know that I'm definitely a kid of Matt and Sansei. Although, I'm starting to doubt my theory. I also like Snow and Calipi's kid, Kiwi. I'm aware that I don't show my feelings as much as Meru. But I think Kiwi knows, and I think she also likes me.
