I woke up in a dark room. I quickly figured out how to exit my room, but I couldn't figure out how to get outside of the house. I found a note that said 'we are going to vacation to pluto. -mom ' I thought my parents were crazy. There was a war going on in Pluto. Even I could tell. I gave up very quickly trying to find an exit. 

I found a calendar. On the cover it said 2024 CALENDAR. It had a single red dot on April 16th. Later I found a clock that said Wednesday, April 17. Under that, it said 1:03AM.

I was stuck in the dark room until one day, I heard the door open. I ran toward the exit, expecting my parents. I was so excited to meet them for the first time. I was getting closer to the exit. I jumped and hugged my dad... or so I thought. 

There stood a little Manemo about my age. He looked very happy. He held my hand and pulled me towards a giant tower. I looked at it closely. It was the crystal tower! As soon as we got to the crystal tower, many Manemos greeted me, and it was really exciting! The little Manemo came back to bring me to a big dry plain outside and he started posing and dancing. Every other little Manemo in the area came to run with gray and blue glow sticks and big flags. I read the flags. Some of them said I LOVE MERU, while others said MERU IS LIFE. I found an area of flags and glow sticks. I bought a gray glow stick and a blue glow stick. I also bought a MERU IS LIFE flag. I found a little bit of money in the dark room so I spent it on the flags. Every little Manemo was cheering and laughing and smiling. I was also smiling. Later that day, I went towards Meru to say thank you, and he was very happy. He was very pure and cute. I told him that, and instead of blushing, he smiled and hugged me. Later, I went to go get a snack from the crystal tower, when I heard this:

"I finally have a girlfriend! Well SNOW, I guess we're tied now!" said Meru.

"..." said another Manemo, probably snow, because he also had a little Manemo with red streaks in her hair.

"Can I see your girlfriend?" asked the little Manemo with red streaks in her hair next to Snow.

"YEAH!" said Meru. 

Grinning, Meru said to another little Manemo, who looked very similar to Meru.

"I guess YOU don't have a boyfriend yet MIST!" said Meru.

"Say THAT again!" said Mist.

I went next to Meru. 

"Hello." said I.
