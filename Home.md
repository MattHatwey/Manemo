Welcome to the MattHatwey.github.io wiki!

Manemo land first started when the first war of Manemo began. Before Manemo land or Manemo tribe was created, the Manemo was split in two groups. One group was the blue wing bird, and the other was red land bird. One day, they got into a big argument and started a war. (B.C. 1115 7/14 ~ B.C. 1115 12/24) The war ended very quickly because two of them ( two Manemo ) in a different group married and became the king (blue wing bird) and queen (red land bird).

Many years later, (B.C. 100) The two groups managed to combine into one group (Manemo) and soon became a tribe. Two millennia later, (1900 A.D.) the second war (The Great War) began because of a confusion. Since their great accomplishment had been forgotten and they did not do a good job in ruling their small town, the Manemo who lived there started to complain. Soon after, a governor was made, but the king and queen did not notice that the governor was made for betraying them. In 1999, the king and queen were killed by a brew that was for killing people, but luckily they could save their children King Darudo and Queen Darudo (both age 23), and their cousin (age 17) who made Hatwey (Hatwey Firewing in 2005). The moment they (the king and queen, aka the old king and queen) were killed, they became bad Manemo and attacked all of the town. Matt was born the moment everything turned into ash.
