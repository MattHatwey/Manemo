I was always scared of everything. Even the day I was born, I was scared. I was scared everyday, every second. Until I just forgot about it. Pretended it didn't exist. Pretended I didn't exist. I just sat there, thinking "Why do I exist? Why do I not die?" 

Orion, Castor, Mira, and Rigel. Those names I could never forget. I can't really remember my name, and to this day, I just called myself Vega. It was the bright star on scorpio. I remember looking at it. It was so large, and bright. If only I was that bright.

The others realized that we were born in the same place. It was those dark prison cells. It was probably a Bad Manemo Castle's prison cells.

Orion was always very kind to me. He would do anything to make me happy. He made me smile. I loved him. But I was scared that he didn't like me. I tried to forget, but nothing worked. So I ran away from him. I felt sorry.

Soon, like I wished the memories of the past faded away, but the day that I met Orion and the others, I could never forget. And after that, everything to me felt like a precious memory, and I never forgot anything anyone said or did after that day.

Recently, we escaped the prison cell because one of the Bad Manemos forgot to lock the gate. They ran toward the sunrise, and I followed. We watched the sun rise, and although everyone was fine, the light was blinding me. But it wasn't bad. It felt warm. Soon, my eyes could see properly. We watched everything come to life. The flowers, the animals, the sky, everything seemed to come to life. It felt like a miracle to me. I will never forget that day, ever. I made a promise to myself to never, forget this day.

We were soon chatting together, happily, until we saw a town infront of us. Then, Matt and Sansei appeared. I vaguely remembered a Bad Manemo saying those names.
