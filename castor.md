I remember the day I was born, but after that, I don't remember. The memories feel so vague and foggy. Even my birthday. I vaguely remember it.

Until I met the others. Vega, Orion, Mira, and Rigel. Even the day that I met them feels only vaguely familiar.

I soon found out that the others also couldn't remember that much, and we realized we were born in the same place. It was those dark prison cells. It was probably a Bad Manemo Castle's prison cells.

Mira became my girlfriend because we were both very similar in age. I liked her, she was loud, but I like her. She LOVES me.

Soon, the memories of the past faded away, but since that first day that I met Mira and the others, I never forgot anything anyone said or did. Even the first day I met them started to become more vivid the more I thought about it.

Recently, we escaped the prison cell because one of the Bad Manemos forgot to lock the gate. We ran toward the sunrise. As the sun rose, we watched everything come to life. The flowers, the animals, the sky, everything seemed to come to life. It felt like a miracle to me. I may have sounded like a 7 year old when I said that, but it was true. I will never forget that miracle.

We were soon chatting together, happily, until we saw a town infront of us. Then, Matt and Sansei appeared. I vaguely remembered a Bad Manemo saying those names.
