I remember the day I was born, but after that, I don't remember. The memories feel so vague and foggy. Even my birthday. I vaguely remember it.

Until I met the others. Vega, Orion, Mira, and Rigel. Even the day that I met them feels only vaguely familiar.

I soon found out that the others also couldn't remember that much. We soon realized we were born in the same place. It was those dark prison cells. It was probably a Bad Manemo Castle's prison cells.

Mira became my girlfriend because we were both very similar in age. I liked her, she was loud, but I like her. She LOVES me.
