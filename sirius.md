Sirius

I woke up next to my twin. It was sunny outside. I feel like I live in heaven! I get so much food. I'm glad I was born here. I decided to prank Manemos in the house because I was bored. My twin sister, Bubble also liked pranks. Although, her pranks were too extreme.

Soon we were called the pranksters.

It was really fun to splash water on Manemos' heads. I never get bored of it!
