I woke up next to my twin. It was sunny outside. I was just born, and I feel like I live in heaven! I get so much food. I'm glad I was born here. 

I decided to prank Manemos in the house because I was bored. My twin sister, Sirius also liked pranks. Although, her pranks weren't fun.

Soon we were called the pranksters. But sometimes Manemos would call me the Chaos Queen! I loved it!

I also love throwing peanuts at Manemos. They got mad and threw them back at me. I threw walnuts at them!

I will never throw a cashew nut though. I love those!
