Bubble

I woke up next to my twin. It was sunny outside. I was just born, and I feel like I live in heaven! I get so much food. I'm glad I was born here. 

I decided to prank Manemos in the house because I was bored. My twin sister, Sirius also liked pranks. Although, her pranks weren't fun.

Soon we were called the pranksters. But sometimes Manemos would call me the Chaos Queen! I loved it!
