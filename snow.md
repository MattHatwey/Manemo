I woke up on December 21st. Another boring life, and another boring birthday. I was born in the Crystal tower, which I wanted to live in my past life. Not anymore though... 

I was named Snow. I could already use snow related powers because the last life I was in I was killed in a war from a different planet.

Four days after I was born, Matt and Sansei had a wedding. I was really bored. Then the goddess of stars came over to tell us about something strange. It was Masa. Masa told us that this random kid helped him. She was really cute.
