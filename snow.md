Snow

I woke up on December 21st. Another boring life, and another boring birthday. I was born in the Crystal tower, which I wanted to live in my past life. Not anymore though... 

I was named Snow. I could already use snow related powers because the last life I was in I was killed in a war.

Four days after I was born, Matt and Sansei had a wedding. I was really bored. Then the goddess of stars came over to tell us about something strange. It was Masa. Masa told us that this random kid helped him. She had a knife. She looked really scared. She looked like that one lively kid from the war just before I died.

I knew that she wanted to keep being the energetic and lively kid she was. She was the only happy Manemo around. She was the only kid in that old town. 

Earlier, I saw a girl pick up the Heles Charm, and put it to her chest. Suddenly, I saw magic coming out of me. It was going to the millions of pieces of glass next to her. But she wasn't dying or turning into a bad Manemo. I looked at the glass, but it was gone. It was a Manemo. He was Masa, and thanked her. He was not wearing the Heles Charm. It was the same girl from that war.

Now I was interested about her. She was probably older than me. She stared at me. So did I. When they decided that she was coming to their house, I smiled. A few seconds later, she was smiling. She said she didn't know what happiness was, and I could tell. 

"But that was a real smile." I said.

I stared at her, and she held my hand. I also held her hand. My heart felt warm. I had never felt happiness like this. I liked it. I decided maybe it would be nice if I lived as Snow.
