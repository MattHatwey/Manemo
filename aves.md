I woke up one day. I feel like I haven't opened my eyes in so long. I am in a jungle. I don't see anyone here though. Maybe they went to get some food for me? I don't know. But I don't like this place. It's too hot here. So I decided to go somewhere else. I wonder where I'll end up.

I started swimming. It was really warm in the water, but I couldn't swin that well, so I decided to fly. This is much faster. I see something... 

I woke up in a dark room. It looked like I was trapped. I saw a window in the back. I broke out of it. I found something in front of me. It was beautiful. It was nothing like the jungle! There were black towers with lights, weird moving objects on a grey road, and trains everywhere. Everywhere I looked was like magic! I loved it here. Suddenly I was captured back into the cell.
