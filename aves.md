Aves

I woke up one day. I feel like I haven't opened my eyes in so long. I am in a jungle. I don't see anyone here though. Maybe they went to get some food for me? I don't know. But I don't like this place. It's too hot here. So I decided to go somewhere else. I wonder where I'll end up.

I started swimming. It was really warm in the water, but I couldn't swin that well, so I decided to fly. This is much faster. I see something... 

I woke up in a dark room. It looked like I was trapped. I saw a window in the back. I broke out of it. I found something in front of me. It was beautiful. It was nothing like the jungle! There were tall houses with lights, weird moving objects on a red and brown road, and black spots walking and flying around. Everywhere I looked was like magic! I loved it here. 

Suddenly I was captured back into the cell.

"Sorry for capturing you. What is your name? Why are you a mix of a Manemo and Bird? Those species went extinct a year ago!" said a kind voice.

"I'm aves. I don't know what a Manemo is, and I also don't know what I look like. I didn't know that. When I was born, I couldn't find any signs of my family. Maybe they did go extinct." said I. I was scared of this 'Manemo'. She sounded kind, but...

"Thank you for explaining. One last question." asked the Manemo.

"Yes?" said I.

"Do you like this place?" asked the Manemo.

"I do." said I.

"Good." said the Manemo.

"You may be free now." said the Manemo.

"Thank you." said I.

Maybe she wasn't as mean as I thought.

I lived here for the rest of my life. 

I was staring at Manemos and saying hi to them when suddenly a Manemo came up to me.

"Would you like to live in the Crystal tower?"

"Yes!" said I.
