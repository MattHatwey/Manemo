I woke up in heaven. I was one of those guardian angels that Manemos have. Manemos don't know that guardian angels exist, but it's a tough job, and when you don't even get a single praise, it just makes it harder and tougher.

I was the guardian angel of this Manemo named Flame. She was also from heaven, but she escaped. I also wanted to escape. 

One day Flame was sent back to heaven to be a guardian angel again. Flame couldn't escape this time, so she asked me to escape for her. I was delighted. I loved Flame. She told me everyone who she thought was nice. On the list, there was one Manemo that cought my eye. It said 'kacchan                       p.s. her name is pink but dont tell anyone'. I was so excited. I was walking around in heaven, trying to find the escape. 

I found it! There was a crack where you could fit your head, and maybe your whole body. I tried to go, and it worked! I was falling down to Manemo Land.

I landed head first, but it didn't hurt. Then I saw two Manemos. It was Kacchan and Snow! Kacchan looked at me and blushed. I also blushed. We liked each other, and after I told her the story of Flame, she loved me even more. I told her that I knew her real name. She had so many connections with me, and I even got to go to one of the live concerts that her group was going to. Soon after, we married. Snow and I also became best friends. We would do everything together. The 3 of us...

Flame came back today! I am so happy to see her again after all these years. I hope she hasn't changed. And she hasn't. She is the energetic and loud Flame that I remember.
