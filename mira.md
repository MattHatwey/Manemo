"Who am I?" I asked to myself, quietly. I didn't know who I was, or why I was alive. I couldn't remember anything.

One day, I met Vega, Orion, Castor, and Rigel.

I soon found out that the others also couldn't remember that much, and we realized we were born in the same place. It was those dark prison cells. It was probably a Bad Manemo Castle's prison cells.

Castor became my boyfriend because we were both very similar in age. I loved him, he was loud, but I like him. I know he loves me too.

Soon, the memories of the past faded away, but since that first day that I met Castor and the others, I never forgot anything or anyone after that. Even the first day I met them started to become more vivid the more I thought about it.

Recently, we escaped the prison cell because one of the Bad Manemos forgot to lock the gate. We ran toward the sunrise. As the sun rose, we watched everything come to life. The flowers, the animals, the sky, everything seemed to come to life. It felt like a miracle to me. I will never forget that miracle.

We were soon chatting together, happily, until we saw a town infront of us. Then, two Manemos appeared and let us live in a big tower.
