"'...Next week will be a wedding, perhaps...' Matt couldn't sleep because he was thinking about what the prince said. Matt and Sansei always were best friends and would never fight. Hatwey was too young and also was born from Old Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, who are cousins of Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, and I am the grandchild of Kingdarudo and Queendarudo because the prince is Queendarudo and Kingdarudo's child, and Pattern and the prince made my egg." Everyone else was also thinking about it. Ichigo, Honest, Hatwey, Choco, Earon, Wisteria, and Rainflower grouped up into seperate teams to make the wedding fun and exciting for Matt and Sansei.

"...Good Morning..." said everyone. "The wedding will be in 3 days." said the prince. Prince was going to go with Pattern to the wedding, so he didn't have the time to make a surprise wedding with the others. "What was that strage object you were talking about yesterday?" asked Matt. "I'll show you!" said Hatwey and Honest. Get dressed if you want to come!" said Honest. Everyone got dressed. Sansei decided to watch the eggs.

"It's not far from here." said Hatwey. "You can already see it!" said Honest. "We've arrived!" said Earon and Wisteria. "What is this?" said Matt. "It's an old-fashioned teleporter system." said Sansei. In present Manemo Land, teleporters were very common and had a similar shape to telephone boxes. But instead of calling someone, you could teleport to their houses or anywhere else in the world. But in the past, you were supposed to use a rope hanging down from the ancient tree. "There's a hole where you're supposed to swing below. I don't think this hole is supposed to be here." said Honest.

"You're right!" said someone. "Who's what?" said everyone. "TIME TO BATTLE!" said Odd. There were more robots than before. The same bad Manemo that was in the carriage was standing there next to Odd and Even. "They're too strong. The wind is causing chaos in the Manemo Mainlands!" said Matt. "What do you mean Manemo Mainlands, Matt? You never use that to call our area." said Hatwey. "Hatwey, it's because it's only causing chaos around the good Manemos' territory." said Honest.

"...I'm coming!" I know how to stop the chaos!" said Masa.

"...Did Spade and the others come?" asked Matt.

"...No..." said Masa.

Masa came up to odd, then handed him the cresent moon-shaped charm, which was sewed onto Masa's cape. Odd suddenly shattered into millions of pieces. So did the robots and the other bad Manemos. Masa took off his cape. Matt noticed his hair was black, and colorless. "What happened to your hair? It's as black as back when you were a bad Manemo, too." said Matt. "I will turn into a bad Manemo again soon, so I will explain this quickly." said Masa. "That cresent moon charm is called a Heles charm. It changes bad Manemos to good Manemos, or in Odd's case, because he is such a bad Manemo, he shattered into millions of pieces. Sometimes that can happen. The Heles charm can easily be reattached to a different Manemo. I found this charm, and ever since I got this charm, I became a good Manemo. It is like a reverse spell." said Masa. "One last question." said Matt. "Why are you so old even you were born in the future?" asked Matt. "When you time travel and you were 15, you would still be 15 even if you go to the past, or to the future." said Masa. Matt said "Thank y-". 

Suddenly Masa broke into millions of pieces of glass. 

After that, Matt decided to make a goal. Matt goal was to gather every piece of glass, until she could retrieve Masa. He was the only hope to fix Manemo Land back to what it used to be. Matt also had a goal to find Masa's Heles charm and retrieve Masa. 

Matt found all the shards before the sunset came. Luckily the shards of glass did not get carried far away by the wind. After Matt found all the shards, he started gathering every type of glass. He noticed that some of the glass shards he found had some kind of magic. The last step to retrieve Masa was to find the Heles charm.

"We should go home now. It's getting late." said Honest and Hatwey. "Okay!" said everyone.

When Matt and the others arrived at the crystal tower, Sansei was playing with two baby Manemos. "How are there two Manemos already?" asked Matt. "This one is one of the eggs, and I found this Manemo while buying some food. She looked very poor and sad, so I brought her home! This little Manemo is one year old, and she says her name is Kacchan. She's always very sleepy and is always thinking about something." said Sansei. "About the wedding. I would like to change it to the
