"...Where do you want to live?" said Matt.

"...I would like to go to Neptune." said Rainflower.

"...Why?"

"...I like it here, but I love animals and nature."

"...This place has nature too-"

"...Good morning..." said Sansei.
"You're finally awake!" said Matt.
"What do you mean? It's 6:00AM right now." said Sansei.
"I want to ask you a question." said Rainflower.

"I think you should go where you want to live." said Sansei. "But why do you want to live on Neptune?" said Matt and Sansei.

"I want to restore Neptune to what it used to be." said Rainflower.
"The atmosphere became toxic, so how would you restore it?" asked Matt.
"Please come with me so we could restore Neptune!" said Rainflower.
"But how do we restore it?" said Matt.

At this point, everyone who lived in the crystal tower had come to see what was going on.

"We all don't know how to use magic." said Matt. Everyone was nodding.
"Let's try to learn how to use magic!" said Rainflower.
"That's a great idea!" said everyone.

Everyone besides the prince decided to go back to the Grassland Region again to learn how to use magic without harming any other Manemos who lived in the village.

"Who would like to go first?" asked Sansei.
"How about oldest first and youngest last?" said Matt.
"Sounds good!" said everyone.
"That means me first!" said Matt.
"I always wondered why Pattern called me Snowflake Matt." said Matt.
Matt could feel the magic inside of him.
"I feel the magic!!!" said Matt.

But Matt could not do the simplest form of magic.

"Aww, I felt the magic though." said Matt.
"Me next!" said Sansei.

Sansei could not do the simplest form of magic either.

3 hours had passed, and nobody was able to do the simplest form of magic.

"I hope we can do magic again tomorrow." said Choco and Hatwey.
"Yes." said Ichigo and Sansei.

Everyone felt sad that they couldn't do any magic.
It was getting dark, so everyone wanted to go home.
"Dusk is the worst time to walk around in plain sight. bad Manemos don't like the dark, so they run back home before it becomes night." said Matt.
"But we want to go back NOW!!!" said everyone.

Matt saw bad Manemos in the corner of his eye.

"...Shh. They're coming." said Matt.

"Thought you could hide from us?" said Odd.
"We brought something special that could find you in seconds. Let me introduce you to N/O/N1394 and the other robot Manemos." said Odd.
"You all were doing magic class? Well I'm just going to take all that magic!!!" said all the robots.

Matt and the others could not feel anything though.

"WHY IS THERE NO MAGIC COMING OUT???" said Odd, getting angrier and angrier.
"Maybe it is because they do not have any magic." said N/O/N1394.
"Get ready to go back to prison!" said Odd.

Matt was trying to cut the rope that the robots tied them onto.

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" said Odd, as he pressed a button on N/O/N1394.
Suddenly, so many robots were summoned that Matt couldn't even count how many there were.
All the robots were pointing lazers at Matt and the others.
"I'm sorry Sansei, Hatwey, Honest, Rainflower, Ichigo, Choco, Earon, Wisteria." said Matt, crying.
Everyone else was also crying.

"GET READY TO FIGHT!" said Odd.

Matt closed his eyes. So did the others.

Matt suddenly heard a voice that nobody else could hear.

"...Matt, use your magic, you have magic still inside of you... Snowflake..."

"We can do this." said Matt.
"Can we really...?" said the others.
"Yes we can!!!" said Matt.
Matt started floating in the air, and grew wings. So did the others.

The sky turned dark, and a blizzard had begun. Then, half of the robots were turned to rocks. The robots were all shot by strawberry seeds, and a gust of wind started blowing around N/O/N1394. The other half of the robots were surrounded by wisteria and could not escape. After that, a large fire started, and some dark chocolate was melting, and it became so hot that the chocolate burned some of the robots surrounded by wisteria. Suddenly the grass that was burnt started growing into poison ivy, which made Odd itchy all over, and finally, a magic spell was cast into the grounds, and all of the robots and N/O/N1394 blew up in the sky like fireworks.

"Wait, HOW?" said Odd.

Everyone ignored Odd and walked away.
Odd ran away into the dark.
