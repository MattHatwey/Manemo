"...Where do you want to live?" said Matt.

"...I would like to go to Neptune." said Rainflower.

"...Why?"

"...I like it here, but I love animals and nature."

"...This place has nature too-"

"...Good morning..." said Sansei.
"You're finally awake!" said Matt.
"What do you mean? It's 6:00AM right now." said Sansei.
"I want to ask you a question." said Rainflower.

"I think you should go where you want to live." said Sansei. "But why do you want to live on Neptune?" said Matt and Sansei.

"I want to restore Neptune to what it used to be." said Rainflower.
"The atmosphere became toxic, so how would you restore it?" asked Matt.
"Please come with me so we could restore Neptune!" said Rainflower.
"But how do we restore it?" said Matt.

At this point, everyone who lived in the crystal tower had come to see what was going on.

"We all don't know how to use magic." said Matt. Everyone was nodding.
"Let's try to learn how to use magic!" said Rainflower.
"That's a great idea!" said everyone.

Everyone decided to go back to the Grassland Region again to learn how to use magic without harming any other Manemos who lived in the village.
