"'...Next week will be a wedding, perhaps...' Matt couldn't sleep because he was thinking about what the prince said. Matt and Sansei always were best friends and would never fight. Hatwey was too young and also was born from Old Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, who are cousins of Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, and I am the grandchild of Kingdarudo and Queendarudo because the prince is Queendarudo and Kingdarudo's child, and Pattern and the prince made my egg." Everyone else was also thinking about it. Ichigo, Honest, Hatwey, Choco, Earon, Wisteria, and Rainflower grouped up into seperate teams to make the wedding fun and exciting for Matt and Sansei.

"...Good Morning..." said everyone. "The wedding will be in 4 days, on Christmas." said the prince. Prince was going to go with Pattern to the wedding, so he didn't have the time to make a surprise wedding with the others. "What was that strage object you were talking about yesterday?" asked Matt. "I'll show you!" said Hatwey and Honest. Get dressed if you want to come!" said Honest. Everyone got dressed. Sansei decided to watch the eggs.

"It's not far from here." said Hatwey. "You can already see it!" said Honest. "We've arrived!" said Earon and Wisteria. "What is this?" said Matt. "It's an old-fashioned teleporter system." said Sansei. In present Manemo Land, teleporters were very common and had a similar shape to telephone boxes. But instead of calling someone, you could teleport to their houses or anywhere else in the world. But in the past, you were supposed to use a rope hanging down from the ancient tree. "There's a hole where you're supposed to swing below. I don't think this hole is supposed to be here." said Honest.

"You're right!" said someone. "Who's what?" said everyone. "TIME TO BATTLE!" said Odd. There were more robots than before. The same bad Manemo that was in the carriage was standing there next to Odd and Even. "They're too strong. The wind is causing chaos in the Manemo Mainlands!" said Matt. "What do you mean Manemo Mainlands, Matt? You never use that to call our area." said Hatwey. "Hatwey, it's because it's only causing chaos around the good Manemos' territory." said Honest.

"...I'm coming!" I know how to stop the chaos!" said Masa.

"...Did Spade and the others come?" asked Matt.

"...No..." said Masa.

Masa came up to odd, then handed him the cresent moon-shaped charm, which was sewed onto Masa's cape. Odd suddenly shattered into millions of pieces. So did the robots and the other bad Manemos. Masa took off his cape. Matt noticed his hair was black, and colorless. "What happened to your hair? It's as black as back when you were a bad Manemo, too." said Matt. "I will turn into a bad Manemo again soon, so I will explain this quickly." said Masa. "That cresent moon charm is called a Heles charm. It changes bad Manemos to good Manemos, or in Odd's case, because he is such a bad Manemo, he shattered into millions of pieces. Sometimes that can happen. The Heles charm can easily be reattached to a different Manemo. I found this charm, and ever since I got this charm, I became a good Manemo. It is like a reverse spell." said Masa. "One last question." said Matt. "Why are you so old even you were born in the future?" asked Matt. "When you time travel and you were 15, you would still be 15 even if you go to the past, or to the future." said Masa. Matt said "Thank y-". 

Suddenly Masa broke into millions of pieces of glass. 

After that, Matt decided to make a goal. Matt goal was to gather every piece of glass, until she could retrieve Masa. He was the only hope to fix Manemo Land back to what it used to be. Matt also had a goal to find Masa's Heles charm and retrieve Masa. 

Matt found all the shards before the sunset came. Luckily the shards of glass did not get carried far away by the wind. After Matt found all the shards, he started gathering every type of glass. He noticed that some of the glass shards he found had some kind of magic. The last step to retrieve Masa was to find the Heles charm.

"We should go home now. It's getting late." said Honest and Hatwey. "Okay!" said everyone.

When Matt and the others arrived at the crystal tower, Sansei was playing with two baby Manemos. "How are there two Manemos already?" asked Matt. "This one is one of the eggs, and I found this Manemo while buying some food. She looked very poor and sad, so I brought her home! This little Manemo is one year old, and she says her name is Kacchan. She's always very sleepy and is always thinking about something." said Sansei. "How about this Manemo?" asked Matt. "This one is from one of my eggs. He can already use some ice-related magic." said Sansei. "Wow!" said Matt. "How about we name him Snow?" said Matt. "Great idea!" said Sansei and the others. "Kacchan is playing with Hatwey!" said Sansei. "How? I thought she was one of those quiet kinds of Manemos." said Matt. "My name is Hatwey!" said Hatwey. "What's your name?" asked Hatwey. "I'm Kacchan!" said Kacchan. "Cool!" said Hatwey. And then they started dancing and talking for 2 hours. "December 21st is my birthday." said Snow. Everyone was amazed that Snow knew today's date. "Good Night everyone! I'm not going to shower today." said Matt. "I'm going to take a shower." said Honest. "I'll take a bath!" said Hatwey. "I will take a bath with Snow and Kacchan." said Sansei. "I'll take a shower too." said Rainflower. 

"Good Morning!" said everyone. "Sansei and I will stay home and take care of the Manemos." said Matt. "I will go to Pattern's house for until the wedding." said the prince. "We are going outside to play!" said Ichigo, Choco, Honest, Hatwey, Rainflower, Earon, and Wisteria.

Ichigo, Choco, Honest, Hatwey, Rainflower, Earon, and Wisteria split into groups. Honest, Hatwey, and Rainflower were going to renovate the old building where Sansei and Matt would do their wedding to a very beautiful wedding place. Ichigo and Choco were going to buy decorations and flowers. They were planning to be the flower girls. Earon and Wisteria were going to prepare food for the wedding.

"I'm going to ask the members of 'Harvest Time!' to make the cakes and food." said Earon. "Who's that?" said Wisteria. "They are characters of the event called 'Harvest Time!'." said Earon.

"...Did you call us?" 

"Tiramisu? Creamy? Ai? Con? Kuzu-kun? Waffle? Pancake? Onpu-rin?" said Earon. "Wait, I thought Onpu-rin (Onpu means note) was that popular music artist!" said Wisteria. "If you say Onpu-rin, it sounds like you're saying On-Purin (Purin means pudding), so I started making music and cook!" said Onpurin. "Okay, We'll call you Onpurin from now on! We also want you to make some food for Matt and Sansei's wedding, secretly." said Earon and Wisteria. "Sounds good!" said Onpurin and the members of 'Harvest Time!'.

Over at the store, Ichigo and Choco were buying decorations and flowers. "We also need two baskets!" said Ichigo. "Yeah! We bought all the decorations, so all we have to buy now is two baskets and flowers." said Wisteria. 1 hour passed. Ichigo and Choco were done shopping. When Ichigo and Choco looked at their reciept, they were shocked because it was only 10 dollars. They had calculated how much it would cost and it was about 250 dollars, plus more for some impulse buying. In total, they had more than 300 dollars. Ichigo and Choco bought way more than they expected and they thought it would be over 300 dollars. But it was 10 dollars! 

They looked at the cashier, and she was smiling at us, and Ichigo realized it was Moko-Sensei. She was a teacher at Kyuusei School, and she used to be a very scared of everyone and everything. She told her students that she used to be a cute and fun kid, but after her parents left her in her aunt's house, everything changed. Moko-Sensei was told that she was stupid, and said she should just dissapear forever. Her aunt even called her 'stupid' or 'who'. But she was rarely even called by her, and when she tried to say something, she was told to shut up. Once Moko-Sensei was 6, she chose to run away and try to dissapear. Moko-Sensei wouldn't eat, she wouldn't move, she wouldn't do anything. She just wanted to dissapear. But she never could. Moko-Sensei decided she would try becoming a teacher, even if she hated to socialize. Moko-Sensei wanted to try to tell the students that they were very important and loved by someone. When a student told her that nobody loved her, she would say that she loved the student, and that she would never forget the student. And she never forgot a single student. Ichigo used to be one of those students who said they weren't loved, but once Ichigo was told that she was loved, she met Leila and Issei, along with Sansei. 

Ichigo hugged Moko-Sensei, and said she should come to the wedding too. Sansei probably knew Moko-Sensei because Ichigo and Sansei were the same age, and there was only one school in Kyuusei.

Hatwey, Honest, and Rainflower started renovating the building immediatly. Hatwey and Rainflower were good at designing, so Hatwey was told to do the interior, and Rainflower did the exterior. Honest was assigned to build the design that Rainflower and Hatwey thought of, because he was the only Manemo in the group who could use wand magic to make the buildings, and because he wasn't the best at designing. The process went smoother than expected.

By the time the three groups came back to the crystal tower, it had been 12 hours. They started at 8AM, and now it was 8PM. It was time to sleep. "Good Night!" said everyone. the wedding was in 3 days.

The day had come so fast, almost too fast. It was the day of the wedding.

"Too bad that the wedding is in the old building." said Matt. Matt and Sansei were the only good Manemos who didn't know about the renovation of the building. All the flowers, decorations, and food were prepared. The building used to be a very old wooden building, but now it looked like a church mixed with a modern style house (this book was written in 2024, so 'modern houses' these days are just white boxes with black outlines). "Let's go to the building!" said Sansei. "I don't know which one it is though..." said Matt and Sansei. Everyone else pretended to agree with them, but they knew exactly where is was.

"We're ready!" said Matt and Sansei. "Let's go!" said everyone. "I'll navigate where it is." said Honest. "You know where it is?" asked Sansei. "Yeah, my dad told me." said Honest. "Oh." said Matt.
