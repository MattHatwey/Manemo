"'...Next week will be a wedding, perhaps...' Matt couldn't sleep because he was thinking about what the prince said. Matt and Sansei always were best friends and would never fight. Hatwey was too young and also was born from Old Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, who are cousins of Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, and I am the grandchild of Kingdarudo and Queendarudo because the prince is Queendarudo and Kingdarudo's child, and Pattern and the prince made my egg." Everyone else was also thinking about it. Ichigo, Honest, Hatwey, Choco, Earon, Wisteria, and Rainflower grouped up into seperate teams to make the wedding fun and exciting for Matt and Sansei.

"...Good Morning..." said everyone. "The wedding will be in 4 days, on Christmas." said the prince. Prince was going to go with Pattern to the wedding, so he didn't have the time to make a surprise wedding with the others. "What was that strange object you were talking about yesterday?" asked Matt. "I'll show you!" said Hatwey and Honest. Get dressed if you want to come!" said Honest. Everyone got dressed. Sansei decided to watch the eggs.

"It's not far from here." said Hatwey. "You can already see it!" said Honest. "We've arrived!" said Earon and Wisteria. "What is this?" said Matt. "It's an old-fashioned teleporter system." said Honest. In present Manemo Land, teleporters were very common and had a similar shape to telephone boxes. But instead of calling someone, you could teleport to their houses or anywhere else in the world. But in the past, you were supposed to use a rope hanging down from the ancient tree. "There's a hole where you're supposed to swing below. I don't think this hole is supposed to be here." said Honest.

"You're right!" said someone. "Who's what?" said everyone. "TIME TO BATTLE!" said Odd. There were more robots than before. The same bad Manemo that was in the carriage was standing there next to Odd and Even. "They're too strong. The wind is causing chaos in the Manemo Mainlands!" said Matt. "What do you mean Manemo Mainlands, Matt? You never use that to call our area." said Hatwey. "Hatwey, it's because it's only causing chaos around the good Manemos' territory." said Honest.

"...I'm coming!" I know how to stop the chaos!" said Masa.

"...Did Spade and the others come?" asked Matt.

"...No..." said Masa.

Masa came up to odd, then handed him the cresent moon-shaped charm, which was sewed onto Masa's cape. Odd suddenly shattered into millions of pieces. So did the robots and the other bad Manemos. Masa took off his cape. Matt noticed his hair was black, and colorless. "What happened to your hair? It's as black as back when you were a bad Manemo, too." said Matt. "I will turn into a bad Manemo again soon, so I will explain this quickly." said Masa. "That cresent moon charm is called a Heles charm. It changes bad Manemos to good Manemos, or in Odd's case, because he is such a bad Manemo, he shattered into millions of pieces. Sometimes that can happen. The Heles charm can easily be reattached to a different Manemo. I found this charm, and ever since I got this charm, I became a good Manemo. It is like a reverse spell." said Masa. "One last question." said Matt. "Why are you so old even you were born in the future?" asked Matt. "When you time travel and you were 15, you would still be 15 even if you go to the past, or to the future." said Masa. Matt said "Thank y-". 

Suddenly Masa broke into millions of pieces of glass. 

After that, Matt decided to make a goal. Matt goal was to gather every piece of glass, until she could retrieve Masa. He was the only hope to fix Manemo Land back to what it used to be. Matt also had a goal to find Masa's Heles charm and retrieve Masa. 

Matt found all the shards before the sunset came. Luckily the shards of glass did not get carried far away by the wind. After Matt found all the shards, he started gathering every type of glass. He noticed that some of the glass shards he found had some kind of magic. The last step to retrieve Masa was to find the Heles charm.

"We should go home now. It's getting late." said Honest and Hatwey. "Okay!" said everyone.

When Matt and the others arrived at the crystal tower, Sansei was playing with two baby Manemos. "How are there two Manemos already?" asked Matt. "This one is one of the eggs, and I found this Manemo while buying some food. She looked very poor and sad, so I brought her home! This little Manemo is one year old, and she says her name is Kacchan. She's always very sleepy and is always thinking about something." said Sansei. "How about this Manemo?" asked Matt. "This one is from one of my eggs. He can already use some ice-related magic." said Sansei. "Wow!" said Matt. "How about we name him Snow?" said Matt. "Great idea!" said Sansei and the others. "Kacchan is playing with Hatwey!" said Sansei. "How? I thought she was one of those quiet kinds of Manemos." said Matt. "My name is Hatwey!" said Hatwey. "What's your name?" asked Hatwey. "I'm Kacchan!" said Kacchan. "Cool!" said Hatwey. And then they started dancing and talking for 2 hours. "December 21st is my birthday." said Snow. Everyone was amazed that Snow knew today's date. "Good Night everyone! I'm not going to shower today." said Matt. "I'm going to take a shower." said Honest. "I'll take a bath!" said Hatwey. "I will take a bath with Snow and Kacchan." said Sansei. "I'll take a shower too." said Rainflower. 

"Good Morning!" said everyone. "Sansei and I will stay home and take care of the Manemos." said Matt. "I will go to Pattern's house for until the wedding." said the prince. "We are going outside to play!" said Ichigo, Choco, Honest, Hatwey, Rainflower, Earon, and Wisteria.

Ichigo, Choco, Honest, Hatwey, Rainflower, Earon, and Wisteria split into groups. Honest, Hatwey, and Rainflower were going to renovate the old building where Sansei and Matt would do their wedding to a very beautiful wedding place. Ichigo and Choco were going to buy decorations and flowers. They were planning to be the flower girls. Earon and Wisteria were going to prepare food for the wedding.

"I'm going to ask the members of 'Harvest Time!' to make the cakes and food." said Earon. "Who's that?" said Wisteria. "They are characters of the event called 'Harvest Time!'." said Earon.

"...Did you call us?" 

"Tiramisu? Creamy? Ai? Con? Kuzu-kun? Waffle? Pancake? Onpu-rin?" said Earon. "Wait, I thought Onpu-rin (Onpu means note) was that popular music artist!" said Wisteria. "If you say Onpu-rin, it sounds like you're saying On-Purin (Purin means pudding), so I started making music and cooking!" said Onpurin. "Okay! We also want you to make some food for Matt and Sansei's wedding, secretly." said Earon and Wisteria. "Sounds good!" said Onpurin and the members of 'Harvest Time!'.

Over at the store, Ichigo and Choco were buying decorations and flowers. "We also need two baskets!" said Ichigo. "Yeah! We bought all the decorations, so all we have to buy now is two baskets and flowers." said Wisteria. 1 hour passed. Ichigo and Choco were done shopping. When Ichigo and Choco looked at their reciept, they were shocked because it was only 10 dollars. They had calculated how much it would cost and it was about 250 dollars, plus more for some impulse buying. In total, they had more than 300 dollars. Ichigo and Choco bought way more than they expected and they thought it would be over 300 dollars. But it was 10 dollars! 

They looked at the cashier, and she was smiling at us, and Ichigo realized it was Moko-Sensei. She was a teacher at Kyuusei School, and she used to be a very scared of everyone and everything. She told her students that she used to be a cute and fun kid, but after her parents left her in her aunt's house, everything changed. Moko-Sensei was told that she was stupid, and said she should just dissapear forever. Her aunt even called her 'stupid' or 'who'. But she was rarely even called by her, and when she tried to say something, she was told to shut up. Once Moko-Sensei was 6, she chose to run away and try to dissapear. Moko-Sensei wouldn't eat, she wouldn't move, she wouldn't do anything. She just wanted to dissapear. But she never could. Moko-Sensei decided she would try becoming a teacher, even if she hated to socialize. Moko-Sensei wanted to try to tell the students that they were very important and loved by someone. When a student told her that nobody loved her, she would say that she loved the student, and that she would never forget the student. And she never forgot a single student. Ichigo used to be one of those students who said they weren't loved, but once Ichigo was told that she was loved, she met Leila and Issei, along with Sansei. 

Ichigo hugged Moko-Sensei, and said she should come to the wedding too. Sansei probably knew Moko-Sensei because Ichigo and Sansei were the same age, and there was only one school in Kyuusei.

Hatwey, Honest, and Rainflower started renovating the building immediatly. Hatwey and Rainflower were good at designing, so Hatwey was told to do the interior, and Rainflower did the exterior. Honest was assigned to build the design that Rainflower and Hatwey thought of, because he was the only Manemo in the group who could use wand magic to make the buildings, and because he wasn't the best at designing. The process went smoother than expected.

By the time the three groups came back to the crystal tower, it had been 12 hours. They started at 8AM, and now it was 8PM. It was time to sleep. "Good Night!" said everyone. the wedding was in 3 days.

The day had come so fast, almost too fast. It was the day of the wedding.

"Too bad that the wedding is in the old building." said Matt. Matt and Sansei were the only good Manemos who didn't know about the renovation of the building. All the flowers, decorations, and food were prepared. The building used to be a very old wooden building, but now it looked like a church mixed with a modern style house (this book was written in 2024, so 'modern houses' these days are just white boxes with black outlines). "Let's go to the building!" said Sansei. "I don't know which one it is though..." said Matt and Sansei. Everyone else pretended to agree with them, but they knew exactly where is was.

"We're ready!" said Matt and Sansei. "Let's go!" said everyone. "I'll navigate where it is." said Honest. "You know where it is?" asked Sansei. "Yeah, my dad told me." said Honest. "Oh." said Matt.

"What?!" said Matt. "I thought it was a old wooden building." said Sansei. By this time, everyone besides Matt and Sansei were grinning and laughing at each other. "We renovated it!" said everyone who lived in the crystal tower besides Matt and Sansei. The prince was watching with Pattern at the front seats.

The two flower girls (Ichigo and Choco) were walking around with beautiful dresses.

Wisteria and Earon were wearing cute cooking outfits along with Onpurin, Ai, Con, Tiramisu, Creamy, Kuzu-kun, Waffle, and Pancake.

Hatwey, Honest and Rainflower were wearing very fancy outfits.

Matt and Sansei looked very happy.

Pattern and the prince were laughing.

Snow was staring at Matt and Sansei.

The wedding had started. Everyone was smiling, eating, talking with Matt and Sansei, or playing with Snow and Kacchan. The food was very delicious. Everyone was talking, and since every Manemo besides the bad Manemos came, it was very loud, but in a good way. Matt gave Sansei a pure diamond and gold ring. Sansei's dress was tinted with gold leaf, so the ring was perfect. And it was.

Soon the wedding had ended. Everyone was going back home when Sansei brought a Manemo named Star. Earon and Wisteria knew who Star was. She was the godess of stars. She was one of the gods and godesses of Manemo Land. She had a black skirt. She told them that she saw strange objects floating in the sky. Everyone in the crystal tower, along with Star, went to see the objects.

"MASA!" said Matt. "Thank you, Star." said Matt and Sansei.

"I'm back!" said Masa.

"How did you come back?" asked Matt.

"I found this little Manemo here, and she helped me." said Masa.

"Hello. Where are your parents? Why do you have red stripes in your hair? Why do you have a gem on your head? Why do you have a dagger knife in your hand?" asked Matt.

"I don't have any parents. I found this knife, for 'cooking'. I didn't know how to cook. So instead I used this to fight." said Calipi. Everyone was scared of Calipi. "As long as you don't fight me, I won't fight you." said Calipi.

Everyone soon understood that Calipi was scared too, and that was why she had a knife.

"Calipi. It's okay." said Snow. "Don't be scared." said Snow. Calipi looked at Snow and dropped the knife. Snow buried it. Soon they were walking their way toward home, holding hands. "Calipi." said Snow. "Snow." said Calipi.

Calipi was older than Kacchan, but Calipi loved to pretend to be the youngest one. Everyone didn't mind Calipi being the youngest. Snow loved Calipi.

After Matt and the others arrived home, Sansei and Matt decided that they were going to spend their magic on making more kids. Since they were the Emperror and Empress of Manemo Land, they had more magic than they ever needed. Usually Matt and Sansei tried to give magic to Manemos for free, but soon everyone had more magic than they ever needed, and Matt and Sansei still had alot of magic. 

For the next 12 years, Matt and Sansei made many children. Kacchan was already 13, and Matt and Sansei found a few lost kids, and all of them wanted to live in the Crystal tower. 

Calipi usually was in the Crystal tower. She didn't like attention from Manemos she didn't know. The only times she would go out was when she needed to buy food from the grocery. 

Kacchan seemed to have a completly different life hidden from her family. Kacchan's actual name was Pink, and she was one of the popular idols of Manemo Land. 'Peekaboo IdoLz' was the name of the group she was in. It was a group of Lemon, who is a peekaboo(peekaboo is a type of bird),Mirage, and Pink. Mirage and Kacchan(Pink) were friends since elementary school. Pink had no friends. But she loved to dance. One day, a girl named Mirage sat next to her. Mirage was new at the school. They loved to dance. Pink brought a idol uniform to school, and so did Mirage. They would escape from school by climbing the fence(keep in mind that these two were still 7). They would go to big concerts, and would dance. They were always told that they weren't allowed inside, but they didn't care. Soon many Mirage and Pink had many fans. And 7 years later, they named their group 'Peekaboo IdoLz' because a peekaboo named Lemon joined and named the group. Everyone immediatly got used to Lemon in Pink and Mirage's live concert. A lot of Manemos were fans of Lemon, too.

Obsidian was a mysterious Manemo. He was the spirit of Flame, the youngest Manemo in Matt's family. Obsidian was summoned by the gods after Flame was sent to heaven one day. 

Snow loved to go outside, and feel the cool breeze. He liked Obsidian, who first appeared when Snow was 9. Snow also liked Flame. After 12 years, Snow still loves Calipi more than anyone in the world, and when he comes back home for dinner, Calipi would always wait in the entrance of the crystal tower. They even made a kid named Kiwi, who was two. 

Meru loved guns. He would love to look cool, and attracted many girls. He would fight until his guns broke(he has 27 guns so far). He was actually very kind, but loved to tease his twin, Mist. One time Meru tried to shoot Mist when Mist stole 9 of his precious guns. Meru also loves a cute girl named Heather. Meru and Heather made a kid named Haru.

Mist was a very kind Manemo. She liked to help Sansei, and play with her siblings. But when Meru would tease her, she started a big fight with Meru, and they would fight for 2 hours minimum.

Aves was a Manemo who came from a different place. He was the first sign of Mirds(Manemo Birds). Soon the species was created, using Aves' magic. He also liked Esper.

Esper was best friends with Aves. Esper and Crystal ran a Boba Tea place named Bubble Lake Boba. Crystal and Esper are considered the best siblings of all time.

Crystal loves Esper. Crystal does everything with Esper. She has special Crystal-related powers.

Sirius is the twin of Bubble. Sirius is a prankster. She loves to surprise Manemos suddenly by jump scaring them, or suddenly splashing them with water. Sirius likes to play with Mist.

Bubble is the twin of Sirius. She is chaotic and even more of a prankster than Sirius. Bubble likes to play with Mist, but sometimes pranks her. Bubble puts paint inside of the shower heads, and steals Meru's guns. She also throws peanuts at Manemos, and loves to ride her unicycle and eat cake at the same time. She also throws walnuts at Manemos who throw peanuts back at her. Bubble loves cashew nuts, so she never throws them. Even Sirius can't catch up to her.

Heles is the twin of Reverse. They brought Shirottori- and Flame to Manemo Land by spinning around in circles. Heles was bored so she started spinning, and she bumped into Reverse, who also started spinning. Suddenly they arrived in the beatiful white world.

Reverse is the twin of Heles. Reverse follows after Heles all the time, even to weird places such as a bar that Heles went to.

Haru is the child of Meru and Heather. She likes to play, but usually likes to play alone.

Kiwi is the child of Snow and Calipi. Unlike Calipi, she does not know how to fight. She likes to read quietly.

Flame once lived in a beatiful white world, along with a Manemo named Shirottori- (White Bird). Flame was brought to the Crystal tower by Heles and Reverse. Obsidian was Flame's spirit when she was sent to heaven.

One day, Rainflower made her own breakfast and ate by herself. 

"What happened?" asked Matt and the others

"..." said Rainflower.

"She wants to go to Neptune!" said Haru.

"..!" 

"Oh." said Matt.

"..." 

"I'm sorry about forgetting your plan to go to Neptune to restore it. After that we went to practice our magic, and then I went inside of the mirror, then we went to the wedding, then we made kids, and..." said Matt.

"THEN LET'S JUST GO NOW!" said Rainflower.

"Okay!" said Matt and the others.

"...So we need special gas masks..." said Matt.

"How about this?" said Bubble. She made a Bubble with her magic, and put it on her head. She made another around her whole body, overlapping the head Bubble. Sirius put metal polish that she got from somewhere all over Bubble's head. Nothing happened to Bubble. "WOW!" said everyone. Bubble made bubbles for everyone. "Now we need a rocket." Everyone did not know how to make a rocket. Even Honest did not know how to make one. Calipi asked Honest to make a large piece of metal. Then she started denting the metal, making the shape of the rocket. She made a nice looking rocket. Snow was now inspired to finish making it. He started fixing some over-dented areas, and added interior. It was done. At this stage of the rocket, everyone was thinking about the fire. Then they all looked at Flame and Hatwey. Everyone brought the rocket outside, and Flame and Hatwey launched the rocket. Honest used magic to stop it from launching immediatly. Everyone brought snacks and food and pillows and blankets. There was a built in shower in the bathroom too. Everyone went in, and before they launched the rocket, Bubble covered the area where the fire was with a bubble.

Every good Manemo watched as the rocket launched.

"Wow! This is amazing!" said Matt and the others.
