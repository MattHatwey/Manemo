"...Where do you want to live?" said Matt.

"...I would like to go to Neptune." said Rainflower.

"...Why?"

"...I like it here, but I love animals and nature."

"...This place has nature too-"

"...Good morning..." said Sansei.
"You're finally awake!" said Matt.
"What do you mean? It's 6:00AM right now." said Sansei.
"I want to ask you a question." said Rainflower.

"I think you should go where you want to live." said Sansei. "But why do you want to live on Neptune?" said Matt and Sansei.

"I want to restore Neptune to what it used to be." said Rainflower.
"The atmosphere became toxic, so how would you restore it?" asked Matt.
"Please come with me so we could restore Neptune!" said Rainflower.
"But how do we restore it?" said Matt.

At this point, everyone who lived in the crystal tower had come to see what was going on.

"We all don't know how to use magic." said Matt. Everyone was nodding.
"Let's try to learn how to use magic!" said Rainflower.

"Sounds good!" said everyone.
"That means me first!" said Matt.
"I always wondered why Pattern called me Snowflake Matt." said Matt.

"I feel the magic!!!" said Matt.

But Matt could not do the simplest form of magic.

"Aww, I felt the magic though." said Matt.
"Me next!" said Sansei.

Sansei could not do the simplest form of magic either.

3 hours had passed, and nobody was able to do the simplest form of magic.

"I hope we can do magic again tomorrow." said Choco and Hatwey.
"Yes." said Ichigo and Sansei.

Everyone felt sad that they couldn't do any magic.
It was getting dark, so everyone wanted to go home.
"Dusk is the worst time to walk around in plain sight. bad Manemos don't like the dark, so they run back home before it becomes night." said Matt.
"But we want to go back NOW!!!" said everyone.

Matt saw bad Manemos in the corner of his eye.

"...Shh. They're coming." said Matt.
"Thought you could hide from us?" said Odd.
"We brought something special that could find you in seconds. Let me introduce you to N/O/N
