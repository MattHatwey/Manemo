"...Next week will be a wedding, perhaps..." Matt couldn't sleep because he was thinking about what the prince said. Matt and Sansei always were best friends and would never fight. Hatwey was too young and also was born from Old Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, who are cousins of Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, and I am the grandchild of Kingdarudo and Queendarudo because the prince is Queendarudo and Kingdarudo's child, and Pattern and the prince made my egg. Everyone else was also thinking about it. Ichigo, Honest, Hatwey, Choco, Earon, Wisteria, and Rainflower grouped up into seperate teams to make the wedding fun and exciting for Matt and Sansei.

"...Good Morning..." said everyone. "The wedding will be in 3 days." said the prince. Prince was going to go with Pattern to the wedding, so he didn't have the time to make a surprise wedding with the others. "What was that strage object you were talking about yesterday?" asked Matt. "I'll show you!" said Hatwey and Honest. Get dressed if you want to come!" said Honest. Everyone got dressed.

"It's not far from here." said Hatwey. "You can already see it!" said Honest. "We've arrived!" said Earon and Wisteria. "What is this?" said Matt. "It's an old-fashioned teleporter system." said Sansei. In present Manemo Land, teleporters were very common and had a similar shape to telephone boxes.

"There's a hole where you're supposed to swing below. I don't think this hole is supposed to be here." said Honest.

"You're right!" said someone. "Who's what?" said everyone. "TIME TO BATTLE!" said Odd. There were more robots than before. The same bad Manemo that was in the carriage was standing there next to Odd and Even. "They're too strong. The wind is causing chaos in the Manemo Mainlands!" said Matt. "What do you mean Manemo Mainlands, Matt? You never use that to call our area." said Hatwey. "Hatwey, it's because it's only causing chaos around the good Manemos' territory." said Honest.

"...I'm coming!" I know how to stop the chaos!" said Masa.

"...Did Spade and the others come?" asked Matt.

"...No..." said Masa.

Masa came up to odd, then handed him the cresent moon-shaped
