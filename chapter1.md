There was a land named Manemo land.

One day a Manemo was born in the middle of the Great War of Manemo
land. But if a Manemo is born in the middle of the war, that Manemo
will get the power to do the same thing as the winner of the
war. Matt, that Manemo who was born in the middle of the war got the
power to be evil, and a prophecy named after it had a very important
part that was very good so all the Manemos in that land always would
use it. Everyone would use it, but Matt. Because he had the power to
become evil, he couldn't use it.

He met friends, friends that are not scared of him, friends that could
forgive him, best friends forever. Then, when he got good friends, one
friend said, "Where and how did you live when you were born?" asked a
friend of his. "I don't know." Said Matt.

"Maybe we could go ask the king to help search in the prophecy ball."
said one Manemo from near. "What prophecy?" asked Matt, looking
confused. "You don't know?" said all the Manemos that were around him.
"It was made when you were born." said one friend.

That afternoon Matt went to the castle and said to the king. "What's
that prophecy that was made when I was born?" asked Matt. The king
said to him, "You were alone when you were born, you have to ask your
friends." said the king. "Ok." said Matt.

He asked his friends, "Who won the battle in the Great War?" said
Matt. "The evilness." said one of his friends. "I was born that day. I
can't use it," said Matt. "Why?" asked one friend. "Because I have the
power to be evil." said Matt.
