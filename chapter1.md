"Arabelle! A letter has arrived!" Pattern shouted excitedly. "Thanks Pattern!!" said Arabelle. "Of course!" said Pattern.
After Legendaria dissapeared, everyone lived peacefully. Pattern and Arabelle were friends since long ago. Arabelle came from a different planet named Kyuuseigoku (9 planets). When Arabelle was 12, Kyuuseigoku had a war, and the kids who lived in Kyuuseigoku were forced to leave the planet and were sent to Uranus. Arabelle was one of those kids. 

One day, when Pattern was gathering fruits from a forest, she met Arabelle. "Hello! I landed on this place just now. Would you please help me?" Asked Arabelle. "I will help you! You can live in my house, nobody lives there besides me!" Said Pattern. Pattern's parents passed away long ago. Arabelle thanked Pattern, and from then, they would go to school together, sleep together, and do everything together. That is how they became best friends.

Pattern is crying. Arabelle and Pattern are now adults, so they lived seperately. Pattern became lonely again, so she stared working for a buisness to deliver letters. It was a very hard job, but Pattern was happy to meet Arabelle everyday.

"Help!" "Arabelle??" "I'm so scared!!!" Where are you?" Arabelle woke up in her half broken house. "Pattern!" said Arabelle. "Are you okay Arabelle?" asked Pattern. "Yes, I'm okay!" "Hehe, good!" "Should we run away towards the forest?" "Good idea!" "Let's go!" Pattern and Arabelle made a house in the forest. When they finished building the house, it was already evening. "Arabelle, I'm going to sleep now." said Pattern, sleepily. "Okay. Good night Pattern!" said Arabelle, also sleepily. They both slept and felt safe.　

"...Hey you." 

Pattern woke up. It is the middle of night. "...Just a dream..." Pattern muttered.

"...I am real."

"Wait what? said Pattern. Arabelle is still asleep.

"...Let's make an egg."

"Sure." said Pattern.

It is morning. "Arabelle, something amazing happened in the middle of the night. Do you want to hear the story?" asked Pattern. "Yes!" said Arabelle.

"ARABELLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Pattern screamed.
Arabelle was gathering fruits, but she heard Pattern.
"I'm coming! Wait for me!!" said Arabelle. While Arabelle was running, she was captured by a bad manemo, and so was Pattern. Arabelle and Pattern were sent to a prison. There was one other Manemo.
"Hi! My name is Galaxy Star! Nice to meet ya!" said Galaxy Star. "Nice to meet you too!" said Pattern and Arabelle.
They got along together in the prison.

"We are leaving here."

"It's you again!" said Pattern.

Arabelle was sad to see that Pattern was gone. She was very sad. Galaxy Star was also very sad, but the next day, Galaxy Star was put in a seperate prison cell because Galaxy Star kept nagging the guard of the prison for food.

One morning when Arabelle woke up, she was back in Kyuusei. She was an adult now, and the war had mostly ended. 

  Pattern and the mysterious Manemo’s egg was in their house when suddenly a war broke out.
They were scared. The Bad Manemos were gathering around their house. “Pattern, please stay safe. I will go fight.” He never came back. Soon Pattern also was killed, and the egg was buried underground. 

  One day a Manemo was born in the middle of the 1st war of Manemos. If a Manemo is born in the middle of the war, that Manemo will develop the power of the side that won. Matt  got the power of the Bad Manemos. Those rules were made by the ancient scroll of Legedaria and had many important rules so all the Manemos would always listen to the rules, and create them. Everyone would use it, but Matt.
Because he had the power of evil, he couldn't use it.

  He met friends, friends that were not scared of him, friends that could forgive him, best friends forever.
Until one day, a friend said, "Where did you live when you were born?” “I don't know…” said Matt.
“Maybe we could go ask Kingdarudo and Queendarudo to help search in the ancient scroll ”. Said one Manemo from nearby.
“What scroll?” asked Matt, looking confused.
“You don’t know?” Said all the Manemos that were around him.
It was made on the day of the war." They said.

  That afternoon Matt went to the castle and said to Kingdarudo and Queendarudo; “Will you tell me about the prophercy that was made when I was born?'' asked Matt.
 “You were alone when you were born,” said Kingdarudo.
“Ok.” said Matt.
He asked his friends, “Who won the battle in the war?” said Matt.
“Which war?”
“The war from 6 years ago.
“The evilness.” said one of his friends.
“I was born that day. I can’t use it,'' said Matt.
“Why?” asked one friend.
“Because I have the power to be evil.” said Matt. 

  All manemos were scared of Evilness and the battle.
One day, Matt found out his friends didn’t like him after all.
“Why?” he thought as he was walking.
After he told his friends that he has the power of evil, his friends got scared and ran away. They didn't care about him anymore.
He felt lonely. He lay down and kept on having a dream of an egg he found in the middle of the war and was with the egg and then he thought that the egg was near. He thought for a minute..
Then he knew exactly where it was.

   He found the egg. There was a crack
“Finally.” said Matt.
They were together until he noticed that Kingdarudo and Queendarudo were looking at him.
  But he felt safe.
He rang the bell and Kingdarudo and Queendarudo let him in.

  When he looked at the egg, he felt happy.
  Suddenly, a meteor collided with the land. There were two small Manemos.
Matt asked them to help him, and they said yes.
One Manemo was holding the egg.
  Before, Matt tried to ask his old friends to help, but they didn’t really want to and their boss said “no!” to them, so they didn’t help.
  The King and Queen of the Bad Manemos used to be good Manemos until they were knocked into a volcano by good Manemos. The good Manemos didn’t like the King and Queen and accidentally made them into Bad Manemos. The King and Queen were Hatwey’s mother and father, also known as Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo.
  They killed a lot of good Manemos and somehow turned them into bad manemos.

  Matt tried to stop the bad Manemos, and the two manemos were scared.
The two little Manemos hid deeper inside the bush.

  The number of bad manemos got bigger than ever, so large that only a few good manemos were there to help, when a B.A.D member broke the diamond.

  Matt came rushing to the security code to see the diamond broken.
The little Manemos came running to the diamond too.
“No! The diamond!” said Matt
“How do we fix it?” said Matt.
“I don’t know…” said one little Manemo.
  Matt looked at the diamond. Suddenly the diamond started glowing. Then there was a field of magic that surrounded the bad Manemos. The bad Manemos became good Manemos.
  Then the old good Manemos were able to be with their children.
“Mom!” said Matt.
“Matt!” said Pattern.
Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo were there too. The egg was born. 
It was Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo’s egg. They decided to name her Hatwey.

"What's your name?" Matt asked to the little Manemos.
"My name is Honest. I'm Sansei."
"Who are you?" asked Sansei and Honest. "I'm Matt." "And I'm Hatwey!"

  Matt was 12 years old, Hatwey was 0 years old, Honest was 3 years old, and Sansei was 6 years old. 
  The next day, they ventured to the old castle of Infinity when they saw a carriage with a bad Manemo on it, but nobody besides the bad Manemos know her name.

  The bad Manemo was welcomed by Odd, a fat and mean Bad Manemo, and Even, who was a slave.
The castle ruins were very beautiful.

  “We are interested in making a robot army. We will make the first one. It’s name is N/O/N1394." said Odd
“Make them right now. Even, get some food for me."
“Yes.” said Even. 
“I saw Manemos right now. Capture them.” said the bad Manemo.
“Run!” said Matt.

"...Matt?" "Where are you?" 

Matt could hear Sansei's voice. "Shh. Be careful." said Matt.

"What did you sa- AAAA!" Sansei shouted.

"I told you to be careful." said Matt.

Matt and the others got seperated from each other while running away from the bad Manemos. Matt had a little bit of bad Manemo blood, and the bad Manemos made a machine that would make half-bad blood Manemos into bad Manemos. 

"Matt, what are you doing-"

"...I have captured the first target, Odd." Matt ignored Sansei and started walking towards the castle.
                                      
  Sansei was locked up by Odd and Matt. She felt betrayed by Matt. She was very lonely until the next week.
  "Sansei. I’m sorry. I’ll let you go. I’m a Bad Manemo. Just leave me here. I won’t hurt anybody if you keep me here. Just lock me up." said Matt.
"But you helped me." said Sansei.
"So what. I’m a Bad Manemo. I have bad Manemo blood, and I become a bad Manemo when I'm near a bad Manemo. Lock me up already.”
"But-"
"No. Just lock me up."
"Please Matt, I don't care if you become a bad Manemo near other bad Manemos! You always help me at the end!"
"Okay, you make a very good point. Let’s escape before they find us."
"Let's go."
  During that time, Honest and Hatwey were trying to think of a plan to meet up with Matt and Sansei.

  Hatwey and Honest were halfway there when Matt and Sansei came running towards them.
“Okay! EVERYONE!!! WE’RE GOING TO MAKE PEACE!!!!”
  All the Manemos heard Matt, and the good Manemos agreed to help restore peace. They thought that it would be a good rule for the ancient scroll.

  “Thank you everyone.” 
Suddenly all the Manemos heard Legendaria’s voice, and it was.
  “LEGENDARIA???” said all the Manemos.
“Yes. I have come here to say hello to all of you. Thank you for making peace. We know that there will be war from now on…
  Everyone was cheering before Legendaria could finish her sentence.
  Then, suddenly, a second Legendaria was next to her.
“Everyone, this is Legendarius. She is part of me.” said Legendaria.
“I have come…” said Legendarius.
“Me too…” said another voice.
“YAY!!!! LEGENDARIA AND LEGENDARIUS, and who??” 
“Wait… Enchendaria??” said all the Manemos. 
“Yes. said Enchendaria.
  Enchendaria was a legend back when Legendaria was born. When Legendaria met Legendarius, she also thought she saw Enchendaria. Enchendaria was the bird who watched Legendaria Disappear.

  “Matt, can we talk? Also I would like to talk with your friends too.” said Pattern.
“Okay!” said Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest.
“We should make new last names for you all.” said Pattern.
“I don’t know my last name.” said Hatwey and Honest.
“Then let’s make one!” said Pattern.
“Okay!!!” said Matt.
“Snowflake.”
“Me, right??” said Matt. “But why Snowflake?”
“You’ll find out soon.” said Pattern.
“Peace.” said Pattern.
“Me?” said Hatwey, Honest, and Sansei.
“You, Sansei.” said Pattern.
“Why?” said Sansei.
“Firewing.” said Pattern.
“Probably me.” said Hatwey.
“Mystic.” said Pattern.
“Me.” said Honest.

After the war, there was a beautiful rainbow. Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest wanted to see where the rainbow started.
"Is this a crystal?" asked Matt.
There was a small crystal poking out of the ground.
"Looks like a crystal to me!" said Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest.
"Wha-"
Suddenly, the crystal became bigger and bigger and became a tower, and was shining very brightly.
Other Manemos came to see what was going on.

  The Crystal Tower was big enough to fit more than 100 Manemos. All the Manemos thought this tower was made because of Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest. They were very happy that the war was over.
  “Let’s go inside. It’s probably our castle.” said Matt.
“Yeah!” said Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest.
The castle already had all of the interior in place.
10 pots, 20 carpets, 30 rooms, 2 dining rooms, 3 living rooms, 4 bathrooms, 3 kitchens, and a mirror.

  But this mirror wasn’t just a mirror. It was shining and looked magical.
  
Manemos have never used magic. Only Legendaria could, but after she disappeared she could not use magic. The Manemos thought magic was only for Legendaria, and now that she doesn’t have magic, they thought that the Bad Manemos must have stolen it.
  Matt felt as though he could feel magic inside of the castle. He felt like he had magic in him.
He knew magic still existed. Not only the Bad Manemos, but good Manemos too. 

  Uranus never had a name. Until this point, it was called the land of the Manemos. 
  Matt knew this was land for good Manemos, so he needed to think of a name for each area so Manemos could tell the difference between Bad Manemo territory, and good Manemo territory. 
  Matt decided to name the good Manemos’ land to Manemo Mainlands, and the Bad Manemos’ land to Badland Territory.

For now, there were only two territories.

  Matt, Sansei, Honest, and Hatwey had been living in the Crystal Tower for 2 years.
Matt was 15, Sansei was 8, Hatwey was 2, and Honest was 5 years old.
  They wanted to explore Manemo Land, so they decided to.

Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, Honest have been adventuring for an hour now.

"It's getting dark now, let's go to sleep." said Matt.
"Yeah." said the others.

"...Choco, where did you go??" 

Suddenly, Matt and the others heard a voice.

"...I'm right here Ichigo!" 

Sansei got surprised, and jumped.

"...Choco. There's somebody here!"

Matt decided to ask who they were.

"I'm Choco! and she's Ichigo!" said Choco.
"We are lost." said Ichigo.

"Wait, CHOCO???" said Hatwey.
"Are you...ARE YOU HATWEY???" said Choco.
"Ichigo..." said Sansei.'
"Who are you- wait, are you Leila's little sister of something? You look similar to her." said Ichigo.
"You know Leila?" said Sansei.
"Wait..." Everyone started thinking.

"I knew it." said Sansei.
"Yes." said Ichigo.
"Matt, do you know Arabelle?" asked Sansei.
"Yeah, Pattern told me about her 2 years ago."
"I know Arabelle." said Ichigo.
"Leila's Mom, and my Mom." said Sansei.
"Issei and Leila and Sansei's Mom." said Ichigo.
"Yes." said Sansei.
"How about Ichigo Obasan (Obasan = Aunt)"? asked Ichigo.
"I used to eat her strawberries." said Sansei.
"Me too! They tasted so good." said Ichigo.
"I can still remember the taste of the strawberries." said Sansei.
This conversation went on for 2 hours, and everyone else started talking too.

"We are siblings!" said Hatwey and Choco.
"If you two are Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo's kids..." said Matt.
"And if Kingdarudo and Queendarudo are cousins of the Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo, that means..."
"...Kingdarudo and Queendarudo's kid was the voice that made an egg with Pattern..."
"That means..."

Matt was thinking for so long that even Sansei and Ichigo's conversation ended.

  “It’s so comfortable here.” said Matt.
“It’s just grass here.” said Sansei.
“Yeah.” said Matt.
“The Grassland Region?” said Matt.
  Suddenly, Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, and Honest saw a Manemo.
“Who are you?” said the Manemo.
“I’m Matt, this is Sansei, Honest, and Hatwey.
“I’m Rainflower. I was born here. I’m 6 years old.” said Rainflower.

  Matt, Sansei, Honest, and Hatwey had been adventuring for 1 month.
“We should go back to Crystal Tower. It’s been a long time since we were there and I think it’ll take more than a week to get back home.” said Sansei and Hatwey.
“Good Idea. Do you want to come with us, Rainflower, Ichigo, Choco?” said Matt.
“Do we have enough food for that? We’re already running out of food.” said Honest.
“I think Rainflower may have a plan…” said Matt.
“I’m coming back.” said Rainflower.
“Okay!” said Ichigo and Choco.
  Right before the sun set, Rainflower came back with a ton of fruits.
  “Crystalite Berries, Budding Amethyst Shards, Moon Shards, Cloudberries, and Cotton Fruit.” said Rainflower.
“I knew you could bring the food.” said Matt.
“How?” asked Sansei.
“Rainflower lives here.” said Matt.
“Yes.” said Rainflower.
“Let’s eat!” said Honest and Choco.
“Yeah!” said the others.
“After we eat, we should start on our journey back home. It’s almost dark, but I think traveling during the night is easier. We probably won’t see any bad Manemos.” said Matt.
“Yeah. I don’t want to meet any bad Manemos on the way back.” said Ichigo.
  Once they finished eating and started their journey, it was very dark and cold.

  As the sun started to rise on the seventh day, Matt, Sansei, Hatwey, Honest, Ichigo, Choco, and Rainflower saw the Manemo Mainlands.
  “Matt!!!” said one Manemo.
“Who are the other Manemos?” asked another Manemo.
“I’m Rainflower.” 
“I’m Ichigo!”
“I’m Choco!”
“I’m from Kyuusei, same as Sansei.” said Ichigo.
“I’m the sister of Hatwey!” said Choco.
  “And who are you?” asked Honest.
“Who, me?” said the Manemo.
“Yeah. The one who said “Matt!!!” Earlier.” said Honest.
“That’s me.” said the Manemo.
“My name is Sayo.” said the Manemo.
“And I’m Lightning Star! The one who asked 'Who are the other Manemos?' After Sayo!” said the other Manemo.

While Matt and the others were returning to Crystal Tower, they heard a Manemo and two other creatures.

"...I haven't met Matt yet." 

"...Me neither."

"... Me too."

"I'm right here!" said Matt.

"...Are you the real Matt!?" said the Manemo, and the two cats.

"You wanted to greet me?" asked Matt.

"Yes!" said the two Manemos.
"I am Rui" "I am Dominic." "I'm Fantastic Sakura (F.S.)!"

"Nice to meet you three!" said Matt.
"I like her." said Rainflower, pointing at F.S.
"I like the two cats." said Sansei and Matt.

  Matt, Sansei, Honest, Hatwey, Ichigo, Choco, and Rainflower all lived in the Crystal Tower until one day.
“Matt, you will be our Emperor.” said Kingdarudo.
“Sansei, you will be our Empress.” said Queendarudo.
“We will still be Kingdarudo and Queendarudo, but Hatwey and Honest are going to become the New King and New Queen of Manemo Land.” said Kingdarudo and Queendarudo.
“Choco and Ichigo will rule the Candy Land.” said Kingdarudo and Queendarudo.
“Rainflower, you will live in the Animal Nation.” said Kingdarudo and Queendarudo.
  Everyone was cheering until suddenly next to Ichigo and Choco were two Manemos.
“I’m Wisteria.” said one.
“I’m Earon.” said another.
“And Wisteria and Earon will live in the Tower of Two Sisters.” said Kingdarudo and Queendarudo.

"...Hello...?" 

"Are you-..." said Matt.
"It has been a while since i've met you." said Pattern.
  “Prince?” said Kingdarudo.
“Are you the real Prince?” said Queendarudo.
“Yes. I have been living in the Ancient Forest.” said the Prince.
“Would you like to live here?” said Queendarudo.
“Yes.” said the Prince. 
“Then you can also live in the Crystal Tower.” said Kingdarudo.

"If the Prince is Kingdarudo and Queendarudo's kid, and I am his and Pattern's kid, I am Kingdarudo and Queendarudo's grandchild???" said Matt.

"Honest...? is that you?" said the Prince.
"Good to see you!" said Honest.
"Good to see you too." said the Prince.
