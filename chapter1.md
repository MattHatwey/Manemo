"Arabelle! A letter has arrived!" Pattern shouted excitedly. "Thanks Pattern!!" said Arabelle. "Of course!" said Pattern.
After Legendaria dissapeared, everyone lived peacefully. Pattern and Arabelle were friends since long ago. Arabelle came from a different planet named Kyuuseigoku (9 planets). When Arabelle was 12, Kyuuseigoku had a war, and the kids who lived in Kyuuseigoku were forced to leave the planet and were sent to Uranus. Arabelle was one of those kids. 

One day, when Pattern was gathering fruits from a forest, she met Arabelle. "Hello! I landed on this place just now. Would you please help me?" Asked Arabelle. "I will help you! You can live in my house, nobody lives there besides me!" Said Pattern. Pattern's parents passed away long ago. Arabelle thanked Pattern, and from then, they would go to school together, sleep together, and do everything together. That is how they became best friends.

Pattern is crying. Arabelle and Pattern are now adults, so they lived seperately. Pattern became lonely again, so she stared working for a buisness to deliver letters. It was a very hard job, but Pattern was happy to meet Arabelle everyday.

"Help!" "Arabelle??" "I'm so scared!!!" Where are you?" Arabelle woke up in her half broken house. "Pattern!" said Arabelle. "Are you okay Arabelle?" asked Pattern. "Yes, I'm okay!" "Hehe, good!" "Should we run away towards the forest?" "Good idea!" "Let's go!" Pattern and Arabelle made a house in the forest. When they finished building the house, it was already evening. "Arabelle, I'm going to sleep now." said Pattern, sleepily. "Okay. Good night Pattern!" said Arabelle, also sleepily. They both slept and felt safe.ã€€

"...Hey you." 

Pattern woke up. It is the middle of night. "...Just a dream..." Pattern muttered.

"...I am real."

"Wait what? said Pattern. Arabelle is still asleep.

"...Let's make an egg."

"Sure." said Pattern.

It is morning. "Arabelle, something amazing happened in the middle of the night. Do you want to hear the story?" asked Pattern. "Yes!" said Arabelle.

"ARABELLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Pattern screamed.
Arabelle was gathering fruits, but she heard Pattern.
"I'm coming! Wait for me!!" said Arabelle. While Arabelle was running, she was captured by a bad manemo, and so was Pattern. Arabelle and Pattern were sent to a prison. There was one other Manemo.
"Hi! My name is Galaxy Star! Nice to meet ya!" said Galaxy Star. "Nice to meet you too!" said Pattern and Arabelle.
They got along together in the prison.

"We are leaving here."

"It's you again!" said Pattern.

Arabelle was sad to see that Pattern was gone. She was very sad. Galaxy Star was also very sad, but the next day, Galaxy Star was put in a seperate prison cell because Galaxy Star kept nagging the guard of the prison for food.

One morning when Arabelle woke up, she was back in Kyuusei. She was an adult now, and the war had mostly ended.
