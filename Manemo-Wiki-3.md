 Once his friends knew what happened the friend said that "A manemo was actually good but the power changed some things up, But still who will solve the mystery?"
Almost all Manemo were scared of Evilness and the battle.

But one day, Matt found out the friends did not like him after all.
“Why?” he thought as he was walking.

When he was 6 years old, his friends were nice but when he was 8 years old, his friends did not really play with him.
But he always was older than his friends, 3 years older.
He lay down and kept on having a dream of the egg he found in the middle of the war and was with the egg and then he found out that the egg was near. He thought for a minute..
Then he knew exactly where it was.
 He found the egg.
“Finally” said Matt, looking around to see no one.

He lay with the egg and 6 years later a little crack was getting bigger and then he said to the egg “ Have fun with me” and he saw the manemo.

They were together until he noticed that the king and queen were looking at him.
But he felt safe.
He rang the bell and the king and queen saw him.
