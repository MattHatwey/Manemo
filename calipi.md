“Dear Diary,
	I woke up to the noise of something I’d never heard before. the sound of panic… All around me. I look around to see that the whole neighborhood had burned down, including the small house I live in with my parents…where’d they go…? I hope they show up soon enough. For now, I need to stay positive just like I always am…!

“Dear Diary,
	It’s so strange, y’know? Why I’m writing these words down on this old diary…it’s so stupid… Everything’s stupid. I...I feel like I’m changing somehow... But…I…need to stay happy. That’s what makes myself…me….? That’s the real me…right..?”

	What do I mean by the ‘real’ me..?

 Slowly, I feel myself…somehow break…? I feel…lost…I feel so…strange. I can’t understand myself anymore…
	
  “Day after day, I’ve been writing on and on about anything that comes to mind on this diary. “

	I was the one happy, and possibly the one only kid left. I started hating everything. Everything besides me.

	“That would change soon, wouldn’t it.”

“Dear Diary,
	I’ve always been told that I was a sweet little girl. It always felt to great to me when I could make friends and smile. But, now it feels all fake. Not just because of the fire, and the whole situation. I feel that….maybe it was all fake to begin with…”

	“That can’t be true…can it?”

“Dear Diary,
	I’m..happy...right?”

	“Why did I write this..?”

	“Where..am I?”

“Dear Diary,”

…Dear Diary…

…Dear…Diary…?

	“I started to tear all the pages away…I burned them all in the fire. I only left a single page with a small doodle on it, but my eyes were always so sore and hazy from crying, so I didn't bother to look at it,”

	“Where..am...I again…”

	I started to feel reality slipping through… I couldn’t tell what was real….what was life… what was the diary…everything…?

	“happy…?”

“dear diary,”

…dear diary…

…dear….diary…?

	“I…love…being happy…cause that’s why I exist…”

	I seemed…to throw those words out…randomly…almost forced.

	I started to ask myself obscure questions, and slowly everything seemed to crumble away. It was just me and empty space. Maybe I wasn’t even there anymore. I started imagining Manemos were there next to me, and I wished that someone could guide me. I looked back at the small doodle again. It's been a while since I saw that little thing. I must've drawn it only a few days after the war started.

 ...Its a drawing...of me and my friends. I can't remember their names, and I can't remember a single memory with them.

 That one looks like me...it is me... Who drew this? It isn't me. I guess an old friend...?

"Several days go by, and the only thing keeping me sane is the drawing of me. I've started to use it as my guide, and I call it 'sister' sometimes. The drawing looks like a mature version of me, so it must be my sister. Well, I actually never remember having a sister, but things are so messed up that I don't even care. If it leads to my happiness, I guess I can believe that I really do have a sister."

Now, it feels almost real. Almost..? Actually, it's all so mixed up, that it's real to me. I do have a sister. I really must have...It's all getting to my brain.

I need to see her again. I wonder if I'll remember her, and if she'll remember me. 

"Oh wait, she wasn't real."
 
	“What’s that… a knife..?”

	I slowly bent down to pick it up, feeling an odd sense of numbness. I would’ve never touched it if it was me back then. It’s different now, though. Somehow.

	Every now and then, I sat down and thought about when everything started. From the beginning. No, not life’s beginning. That day when the war started. I wanted to keep being the energetic me, yet I couldn’t. Couldn’t stand it, couldn’t do it.

	Maybe life could’ve just ended there. I had the knife, the tool that could help me go somewhere…anywhere besides this hell. But instead, I walked around aimlessly, hoping to find my happy self. I didn’t want to lie to myself, but I wanted to be happy.

That was my routine, my whole life, until that one day when I was walking around. I had been walking around so much, that I had ended up near a small town, and saw that a wedding was going on. I didn’t know what they were doing, but it looked fun. Then I saw a Heles Charm. In my town, Heles Charms were prized by everyone. I picked up the Heles Charm, and I knew that it could shatter me into millions of pieces. Then my life would be over. I put the Heles Charm to my chest, and it all went black. I couldn’t see anything. Until I saw magic coming out of me. It was going to the millions of pieces of glass next to me. But I wasn’t dying or turning into a bad Manemo. I felt the same. I looked at the glass, but it was gone. It was a Manemo. He told me his name was Masa, and thanked me. He also told me until now, he had to put the Heles Charm, but now he was fine. He thanked me again.
Suddenly a group of Manemos from the wedding came along with the Goddess of Stars. But I didn’t care. What I cared about the little Manemo, probably younger than me. He stared at me. So did I. When they decided that I was coming to their house, I saw a smile on the little Manemo. a few seconds later, he blushed. I asked why he was blushing, and he told me that I was smiling. I was happy that he knew I didn’t know what happiness was. But then he looked at me and said:
“But that was a real smile.”
We held hands on the whole way to their house. I stared at him, and I held his hand. He also held my hand. My heart felt warm. I had never felt happiness like this. I liked it.
