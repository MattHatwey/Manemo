I woke up in this half-burned down house! It's really foggy and smoky. I don't know what just happened but I am scared! I hope I find my parents though, I don't like this fire!!! HELP ME!!! I guess shouting doesn't help! I don't know what my parents are like! 

I was told from everyone that I was a lively kid! I love to be energetic!

I found that I have a gem on my head! I wonder what it is!

I found a knife! That looks sharp! I'm not touching it!

I wanted to keep being the energetic me, but I couldn't stand it. There was war around me, and I was the only happy Manemo around. I was the only kid. I didn't like it. Then I picked the knife up. I knew that the fake me would've left that there. But I don't care. I didn't like lying to myself. 

But there was one part of me that was lively and energetic. I was happy sometimes. And I liked it like that. But soon, it was gone. I thought my life was over. I walked around aimlessly, hoping to find my happy self. I didn't want to lie to myself, but I wanted to be happy. So I started to lie to myself. But it wouldn't work. I gave up. 

That was until one day when I was walking around. I saw that a wedding was going on. I didn't know what they were doing, but it looked fun. Then I saw a Heles Charm. In my town, Heles Charms were prized by everyone. I picked up the Heles Charm, and I knew that it could shatter me into millions of pieces. Then my life would be over. I put the Heles Charm on my chest, and it went black. I couldn't see anything. Until I saw magic coming out of me. It was going to the millions of pieces of glass next to me. But I wasn't dying or turning into a bad Manemo. I felt the same. I looked at the glass, but it was gone. It was a Manemo. He told me his name was Masa, and thanked me. He also told me until now, he had to put the Heles Charm, but now he was fine. He thanked me again. 

Suddenly a group of Manemos from the wedding came along with the Goddess of Stars. But I didn't care. What I cared about the little Manemo, probably younger than me. He stared at me. So did I. When they decided that I was coming to their house, I saw a smile on the little Manemo. a few seconds later, he blushed. I asked why he was blushing, and he told me that I was smiling. I was happy that he knew I didn't know what happiness was. But then he looked at me and said:

"But that was a real smile." 

I stared at him, and I held his hand. He also held my hand. My heart felt warm. I had never felt happiness like this. I liked it.
