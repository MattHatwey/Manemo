Meru

I woke up on a clear morning. I saw a Manemo sleeping by my side. I liked her. But that wouldn't go for long. I started trying to attract her, but she wouldn't even notice. 

So I decided to attract other girls in an attempt to find other girls. I was doing this for a few years, until I found a girl stuck in this tiny shed. I opened the door, and she hugged me. This is what I wanted from the other Manemo that slept next to me, who was named Mist. 

I decided to give up on Mist. Now I have a new friend, her name was Heather. She liked me, and she told me I was pure. I was pure towards girls I like, but not so much for the other boys and girls that I don't like. 

Heather was always very calm, and cute. I loved her more than anything in the world, and so did she. We soon made an egg. Then, Haru was born. She wasn't that energetic towards other Manemos besides us.
