Now that all the celebrations, breaks, events, and whatnot are over, we all have to go work and go to school. Nobody was interested because they wanted to party like last week's celebrations.

Today is the last day of school. The Manemos were all excited for summer break. 

Heles and Reverse didn't want to go to the last day of school because of the long performances they had to do. Since the school year was ending, some future-students and their parents came to see if they would go to that school.

"Well, I guess we have to do it anyways. Good night..." said Heles.

"Okay.." said Reverse.

"..." 

"?" said Heles.

"Oh sorry I was still awake." said Reverse.

"WHY ARE YOU AWAKE!??" said Heles. "Shh! Somebody could hear us!!" said Reverse. "Okay, but it's 3AM right now!!!!!" said Heles. "Really?" said Reverse.

Heles found a blanket on the floor and went beneath it.

"Reverse, you go beneath the blanket too!!!" said Heles. "Why?" said Reverse while going under the blanket.

The two waited in the blanket for something fun to happen. 

Nothing was happening. 

"I can hear birds and Manemos! What's going on!?" said Heles. "I don't know. We only were in the blanket for like 10 minutes." said Reverse. "Let's check the time on the school device!" said Heles.

It read, 10:50AM.

".....!!!!!!????????" said Heles and Reverse.

"We gotta pretend we're sick!!!" said Heles. "How?" said Reverse. "Go on the bottom bunk!!!" said Heles. "Ok!" said Reverse. "You have those hand warmers somewhere right?" said Heles. "Yeah." said Reverse.

The teacher came to Heles and Reverse's dorm room.

"What are you two doing!!! It is already 10:55AM! Wake up NOW!!!!" said the teacher. "But teacher... I feel really.. sick...." said Reverse. "Are you lying??" said the teacher. "No...." said Reverse. 

"Let's see your temperature. 39C??? That is a little bit too hot. Yeah, maybe you should rest, Reverse. "Okay.." said Reverse.

"How about Heles?" asked the teacher. "I got the sickness from her." said Reverse.

"Are you okay, Heles?" asked the teacher. "Not really... I feel.... really, really.... cold." said Heles. "Are you okay??? Let me check your temperature now. 40C??? That is insane!!! Are you okay??? "I don't feel good..." said Heles.

"Let me get you some medicine!!! I will go ask the school nurse!!!" said the teacher. "Thank you..." said Heles and Reverse.

The school nurse came to see them.

"Hello! I heard you are not feeling well. The medicine is right here!" said the nurse. "Thank you..." said Heles and Reverse.

"Sadly I cannot help you right now because we have another student who got severely injured. Are you able to get the water for the medicine?" "Probably..." said Heles. "Okay! Please rest! I hope you feel better soon." said the school nurse. "Thank you...." said Reverse.

The school nurse closed the door and left.

"Okay, I want to play now!!!" said Heles. "The toy box is over to the right of our dorm, right? It's near the drinking fountain." said Reverse. "So we can pretend we're getting water!" said Heles.

Heles went to get the toy box and hid it where it would be easy for Heles to find. Then, Reverse would pretend to get water and fall, and Heles would have to go to the school nurse to say Reverse fell. While the nurse helped Reverse get up, Heles would carry the toy box to their room and hide it in the wardrobe.

The school nurse came soon after to bring Reverse back to the room. Heles was already in the bed, pretending to drink the medicine-diluted water.

The school nurse soon left the room.

Heles and Reverse started making a cute toy house out of wood blocks.

One hour later, Reverse and Heles were done making the house.

"I'm bored. Should we pretend to be one of the future-students coming to check the school. 

"I'll be Cafe Latte, and you'll be Azuki!" said Heles.

"I like the name Azuki!" said Reverse.

Once Heles and Reverse were done dying their hair with washable markers, and brushing it, covering it, and other stuff, they were done.

Heles was wearing a white t-shirt with light blue short jeans. Now Heles was a boy, and her hair was now light brown, almost blond. Reverse's hair was now brown at the top and there was a brown to purple-red gradeient. She wore a blue ribbon.

They talked to the teacher (The principal was Matt, so they didn't want the fun to end so quickly) about being the future-students, and their parents were working that day, so they would come see by them selves. The teacher actually believed them.

Now that they could start the tour, they decided to see if Bubble and Sirius wanted to join their game. 

Bubble and Sirius went to the drinking fountain near where Heles and Reverse were. Reverse and Heles came to them. "Hi, we are the future-students of this school!". Then, Heles whispered "Hi Bubble and Sirius! We are disguised as other Manemos!". "Hello, Nice to meet you!" said Sirius, while Bubble said "Ok, Heles, tell me how to get out of class!" said Bubble. 

Heles started explaining, but then suddendly, Sirius said, "I have a great idea!" and purposely fell on the ground, and Bubble copied. 

Azuki (Heles) went to the teacher to explain that Sirius and Bubble tripped and fell. Bubble and Sirius pretended it was painful, and so the school nurse came again to see what happened. The school nurse told them to rest in the beds in the school nurse's room. Sirius and Bubble were upset that now the school nurse was watching. 

Suddendly, the school nurse got up and told Sirius and Bubble "Are you okay if I leave you two resting here? A Manemo got severely injured a minute ago and I have to help.". Sirius and Bubble smiled with joy "Yes, we're okay!". Now Sirius and Bubble can be free.
