Now that all the celebrations, breaks, events, and whatnot are over, we all have to go work and go to school. Nobody was interested because they wanted to party like last week's celebrations.

Today is the last day of school. The Manemos were all excited for summer break. 

Heles and Reverse didn't want to go to the last day of school because of the long performances they had to do. Since the school year was ending, some future-students and their parents came to see if they would go to that school.

"Well, I guess we have to do it anyways. Good night..." said Heles.

"Okay.." said Reverse.

"..." 

"?" said Heles.

"Oh sorry I was still awake." said Reverse.

"WHY ARE YOU AWAKE!??" said Heles. "Shh! Somebody could hear us!!" said Reverse. "Okay, but it's 3AM right now!!!!!" said Heles. "Really?" said Reverse.

Heles found a blanket on the floor and went beneath it.

"Reverse, you go beneath the blanket too!!!" said Heles. "Why?" said Reverse while going under the blanket.

The two waited in the blanket for something fun to happen. 

Nothing was happening. 

"I can hear birds and Manemos! What's going on!?" said Heles. "I don't know. We only were in the blanket for like 10 minutes." said Reverse. "Let's check the time on the school device!" said Heles.

It read, 10:50AM.

".....!!!!!!????????" said Heles and Reverse.

"We gotta pretend we're sick!!!" said Heles. "How?" said Reverse. "Go on the bottom bunk!!!" said Heles. "Ok!" said Reverse. "You have those hand warmers somewhere right?" said Heles. "Yeah." said Reverse.

The teacher came to Heles and Reverse's dorm room.

"What are you two doing!!! It is already 10:55AM! Wake up NOW!!!!" said the teacher. "But teacher... I feel really.. sick...." said Reverse. "Are you lying??" said the teacher. "No...." said Reverse. 

"Let's see your temperature. 39C??? That is a little bit too hot. Yeah, maybe you should rest, Reverse. "Okay.." said Reverse.

"How about Heles?" asked the teacher. "I got the sickness from her." said Reverse.

"Are you okay, Heles?" asked the teacher. "Not really... I feel.... really, really.... cold." said Heles. "Are you okay??? Let me check your temperature now. 40C??? That is insane!!! Are you okay??? "I don't feel good..." said Heles.

"Let me get you some medicine!!! I will go ask the school nurse!!!" said the teacher. "Thank you..." said Heles and Reverse.

The school nurse came to see them.

"Hello! I heard you are not feeling well. The medicine is right here!" said the nurse. "Thank you..." said Heles and Reverse.

"Sadly I cannot help you right now because we have another student who got severely injured. Are you able to get the water for the medicine?" "Probably..." said Heles. "Okay! Please rest! I hope you feel better soon." said the school nurse. "Thank you...." said Reverse.

The school nurse closed the door and left.

"Okay, I want to play now!!!" said Heles. "The toy box is over to the right of our dorm, right? It's near the drinking fountain." said Reverse. "So we can pretend we're getting water!" said Heles.

Heles went to get the toy box and hid it where it would be easy for Heles to find. Then, Reverse would pretend to get water and fall, and Heles would have to go to the school nurse to say Reverse fell. While the nurse helped Reverse get up, Heles would carry the toy box to their room and hide it in the wardrobe.

The school nurse came soon after to bring Reverse back to the room. Heles was already in the bed, pretending to drink the medicine-diluted water.

The school nurse soon left the room.

Heles and Reverse started making a cute toy house out of wood blocks.

One hour later, Reverse and Heles were done making the house.

"I'm bored. Should we pretend to be one of the future-students coming to check the school. 

"I'll be Cafe Latte, and you'll be Azuki!" said Heles.

"I like the name Azuki!" said Reverse.

Once Heles and Reverse were done dying their hair with washable markers, and brushing it, covering it, and other stuff, they were done.

Heles was wearing a white t-shirt with light blue short jeans. Now Heles was a boy, and her hair was now light brown, almost blond. Reverse's hair was now brown at the top and there was a brown to purple-red gradeient. She wore a blue ribbon.

They talked to the teacher (The principal was Matt, so they didn't want the fun to end so quickly) about being the future-students, and their parents were working that day, so they would come see by them selves. The teacher actually believed them.

Now that they could start the tour, they decided to see if Bubble and Sirius wanted to join their game. 

Bubble and Sirius went to the drinking fountain near where Heles and Reverse were. Reverse and Heles came to them. "Hi, we are the future-students of this school!". Then, Heles whispered "Hi Bubble and Sirius! We are disguised as other Manemos!". "Hello, Nice to meet you!" said Sirius, while Bubble said "Ok, Heles, tell me how to get out of class!" said Bubble. 

Heles started explaining, but then suddendly, Sirius said, "I have a great idea!" and purposely fell on the ground, and Bubble copied. 

Azuki (Heles) went to the teacher to explain that Sirius and Bubble tripped and fell. Bubble and Sirius pretended it was painful, and so the school nurse came again to see what happened. The school nurse told them to rest in the beds in the school nurse's room. Sirius and Bubble were upset that now the school nurse was watching. 

Suddendly, the school nurse got up and told Sirius and Bubble "Are you okay if I leave you two resting here? A Manemo got severely injured a minute ago and I have to help.". Sirius and Bubble smiled with joy "Yes, we're okay!". Now Sirius and Bubble can be free.

Sirius, Bubble, Heles, and Reverse were now free and they could all play, so Bubble and Sirius made drawings while　Reverse and Heles went back to their rooms to also draw.

The school year is finally over. Heles and Reverse decided to go to the park to play.

"I'm bored." said Heles, after playing in the park for 1 hour. "Me too." said Reverse. 

Heles started spinning around as fast as she could. Heles bumped into Reverse, and Reverse started spinning. "I. am..dizzy...!" said Reverse. "..M.e...too!" said Heles. "I.can't..sto.p!" said Heles. "Me..too.!.." said Reverse. 1 hour later, their head became blank. "I don't feel dizzy!" said Reverse and Heles. "Let's try to spin as fast as we can!" said Heles.

"Where is this...?"

"Here is...."

"....?" 

Heles and Reverse woke up to see a white landscape. 

"WOW!" said Reverse and Heles.

"It's cold here." said Reverse. "Yeah. I see a hollow tree over there. Let's go!" said Heles. The inside of the tree was quite warm. "I'm getting some leaves to block the entrance." said Reverse. "Okay!" said Heles.

"...HELES!!!" said Reverse. "What?" said Heles. Heles walked outside of the log. They saw the sky was getting darker, and as it got darker, they saw a faint light glowing.

"...Wow..." said Heles. "...Wait!!" said Reverse. Heles had started running toward the lights.

"..." said Heles. 

"..." said Reverse.

They were in a small town. Manemos were walking around, placing lanterns. One tall Manemo walked towards us.

"My name is Shirottori-. It is getting cold outside, so please come in my house."

"...Thank you, but..." said Reverse. "But there is a little Manemo outside!" said Heles. "Really? I'll go check on them." said Shirottori-.

"HELLO!!!!!!!! YOU'RE HELES AND REVERSE RIGHT!?" said the small Manemo. It was the same little Manemo that was outside. Shirottori- was chasing after her.

"Who are you?" asked Heles and Reverse. 

"I'm Flame!" said the little Manemo.

"Wait... Are you the from the Crystal tower?!" asked Shirottori-.

"Yeah!" said Reverse and Heles.

"Why not come to the Crystal tower?" asked Heles.

"Yes!" said Shirottori- and Flame. "But how?" said Shirottori-.

"Spin around!!!" said Heles.

Reverse and Heles started spinning around. This time it wasn't as chaotic. Flame also started spinning, and bumped into Shirottori-. 

"...Are.you..di..zzy...?" said Heles. 

"...K..ind.of!" said Reverse.

"Me...to..o.." said Shirottori- and Flame.

This time it was faster for Heles and Reverse to make their head blank.

"Not dizzy anymore!" said Heles and Reverse.

"I don't feel dizzy either." said Shirottori-.

"Me either!" said Flame.

Soon they arrived back in the dry plain where they started spinning. It had been 5 hours now, so they bought some food and came back home. 

"I'm Flame!" said Flame.

"Welcome to the Crystal tower!" said Sansei, Matt, and Mist, who was helping Sansei with making dinner.

Shirottori- also came in. He had greeted the kids first. Everyone was interested in Shirottori-.

"Hello. I am Shirottori- from the Snowy Village. Thank you for rescuing us." said Shirottori-.

"What do you mean rescue?" said Flame. Shirottori- whispered something to Flame. Flame smiled but at the same time looked like she was crying.

That night Flame talked to Kacchan.

"...That's sad to hear. It's okay though. I know you can escape again!" said Kacchan.

"I don't wanna go back! This is my home." said Flame.

"It's okay." said Snow.

"..." said Flame.


"....." 

"...Snow..?" said Calipi.

"!..." said Snow.

Calipi looked at Snow. She was good at looking at things in the dark.

Snow was writing something about a ship and drowning and Shirottori- maybe having a connection, but the Shirottori- part was crossed out.

"I thought your other lives were useless." said Calipi.

Calipi stared at Snow.

She saw a pirate ship in Snow's eyes.

"I have a secret." said Snow.

"Yes?" said Calipi.

"In my past life, I was on a pirate ship, and that pirate Manemo you saw saved my life. He would take care of me all the time. He died, and I also drowned because I couldn't live without him. I can't remember his name, and I want to find him." said Snow.

"But he died, right?" said Calipi.

"Yeah, but just like me, he will reborn as a new Manemo, or go to heaven..." said Snow, starting to erase the cross above where he wrote about Shirottori-.

"Snow, only you can remember your past lives." said Calipi.

"Maybe-" Calipi cut herself off.

"?" said Snow.

Calipi smiled. 

"You'll understand soon. You already do." said Calipi.

After that night, he would think of how nice the pirate was, and how similar he was to Shirottori-.

"I have to go to heaven." said Flame, again, to Matt and Sansei.

"I was supposed to be in heaven, which is why Shirottori- whispered something to me a few weeks back." said Flame.

Matt and Sansei were shocked.

"Even Shirottori- went back." said Flame.

"Thank you for the memories." said Flame.

Flame ran towards the door and before she opened it she dissapeared.

Soon after, a boy was found by Snow. His name was Obsidian, and he told us he didn't know who he was. Kacchan saw Obsidian and thought he was very cute. Kacchan liked Flame, and so did Snow. They soon realized what happpened to her. Then everyone in the Crystal tower knew who Obsidian was. Obsidian was Flame's spirit.

Obsidian liked Kacchan too. Kacchan and Obsidian decided to marry each other.

Obsidian could feel everything Flame felt. Sometimes he felt like he was in a different universe even though he was next to someone. Sometimes you could see Obsidian crying in pain. Whenever someone saw him crying, he would laugh, although it wasn't a happy laugh. It was a sad laugh.

One day, Kacchan saw Obsidian crying. Instead of fake laughing, he just continued crying. Soon Kacchan noticed that Obsidian was crying with joy. Flame was behind him.

Flame ran toward Kacchan. Obsidian also hugged Kacchan. Obsidian had finally his own thoughts. Until now, it was just Flame's mind. Flame apologized but Obsidian didn't mind.

Obsidian still loved Kacchan the same, even after he has his own thoughts.


"Aves?" said a Manemo who was on her way to the grocery.

Aves was waving and saying hi to Manemos as usual. This was the second time somebody came up to him.

"Are you...?" said Aves. Suddenly the Manemo smiled. "Yes, I'm back." said the Manemo.

"We would like to do an experiment on you, is that okay?" said the Manemo.

"My name is Leaf." said the Manemo.

"If this experiment works, we will re-create the Mird species. Back when Legendaria was alive, Mirds existed. Some newspapers say that Mirds helped Manemo Land from starting war. The first sign of Mirds dissapearing was found when Old Kingdarudo and Old Queendarudo were dropped in the volcano. Sadly, Mirds became endangered. Mirds went extinct after the first war, but a pair of red and blue Mirds went over to that island where you were born. Then they ran out of food. Then they died. So now, it is only you." said Leaf.  

"I will do it!" said Aves.

"I'm bored..." said everyone in the Crystal tower. "How about we seperate into groups to have fun?" asked Bubble, Heles, Crystal, Meru, and Matt. "Okay." said everyone else.

"Looks like we're in a group." said Haru. "I've never really talked to you, or anyone else, but especially you." said Kiwi. "You just talked." said Haru. "I did." said Kiwi. These two are very quiet and boring. Even YOU are getting bored because of these two. "Why do you talk way more in one sentence than when you talk to me?" asked Haru. "I don't know, but I think the same to you." said Kiwi. "To be honest, you're correct." said Haru. "Should we get a drink? Bubble Lake Boba is open." said Kiwi. "Yeah." said Haru. They got a drink. 

"What flavor did you get?" asked Kiwi and Haru at the same time. Kiwi smiled, Haru smiled, then laughed. So did Kiwi. "I got Melon Kiwi Soda Float." said Kiwi. "I got Haru Fruit Shake." said Haru. They laughed. "Do you love your drink?" said Kiwi. "Yeah." said Haru. "Me too." said Kiwi. Let's go over there next!" said Kiwi and Haru, expecting to say the same location. And they did. "You're smiling!" said Kiwi. "You too!" said Haru.

That crepe was good!" said Kiwi. "Yeah. That ice cream was good too!" said Haru. They went to playgrounds, pools, arcades, food, and more.

"I want to tell you something." said Haru.

"I also want to tell you something." said Kiwi.

"3 2 1" said Haru and Kiwi.

"Thank you!" said Haru and Kiwi.

After playing for 6 hours, they went back to the Crystal tower with game prizes, candy in their pockets, stuffed toys, and more. Everyone looked surprised.

Mirds have been created.
