Crystal

I was born in a warm room. It was a little cold, and the sun was partly covered by the clouds.

I felt like an ordinary Manemo.

I loved my brother, Esper. He was the kindest Manemo in the whole wide world! He always lets me do what I want, and he even started a Boba Tea store just for me! He even let me choose the name. I was still young, but I had chosen a perfect name. Bubble Lake Tea!

But what I liked most about Esper is that he knows a secret. I can use strong powers related to crystals, such as making everything around me up to 10ft away into crystals. I could also make the special Crystal Boba Drink! by adding my handmade crystals. The Boba is made out of sugar crystals, which are also handmade.
