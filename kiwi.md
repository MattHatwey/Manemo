Kiwi

I woke up on a hot day. It was summer break, and everyone was playing. I was not interested. I went to read some books from Snow's book cabinet. I saw a Manemo next to me. I liked her. The Manemo also seemed to like me. I could tell. We wouldn't talk much, but as we grew older, instead of seperating, we bonded closer than ever.
