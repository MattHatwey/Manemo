Kiwi

I woke up on a hot day. It was summer break, and everyone was playing. I was not interested. I thought of something to do, and I found Snow's bookshelf. It was hard to reach, but Snow put his favorite books on the middle shelf, so I could barly reach it.

I went to read some books from Snow's book cabinet. I was reading for quite a bit before I saw a Manemo next to me. I liked her. She stared at me, and smiled a bit.

The Manemo also seemed to like me. I could tell. We wouldn't talk much, but as we grew older, instead of seperating, we bonded closer than ever. She was there for me, and I was there for her too.
