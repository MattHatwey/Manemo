  The manemo had been born,  he felt sad, but when he looked at the manemo, he felt happy.

First Matt asked his old friends to help, they wanted to but their boss said “no!” to them, and they did help.

Bad Manemo King Infinity and Queen Infinity were good Manemos, but there were none the first time when good Manemos did not like Hatwey’s cousin’s parents and made them into bad Manemos.

They killed a lot of good Manemos and somehow turned them into bad manemos.
The battle bird said “Battle!” while looking at the battle.
And

Matt used his powers, then Hatwey was surprised, but scared.
She hid in the bush and Honest was too, but he hid more deep inside the bush.
Bad manemos, the number of bad manemos got bigger than ever, so large that only a few good manemos were there to help, when a B.A.D member broke the diamond.

Matt Came rushing to the door (the security code) To see the diamond broken.
Hatwey and Honest came running to the diamond too.
“No! The diamond!” Said Hatwey, crying with Honest.
“I know how to fix it!” Said Matt.
“Really? Said Honest.
“Yes,” Said Matt.

Matt made the diamond again but he suddenly evolved into a mega diamond.
Hatwey and Honest’s diamonds were glowing.
Manemos were Popping out of the Bad Manemos.

Then the old good Manemos were able to be with their children.
“Mom!” Said Matt.
“Matt” said Page Pattern(as known as the mother of Matt).
“Mom, Dad?” Said Hatwey.
“Hatwey” Said The old king and old queen( as known as Hatwey’s parents).
