HISTORY OF MANEMO

  Uranus used to be in the solar system. There were no inhabitants, until one day, the solar system was gone. Then there was one Manemo named Legendaria. 
        Legendaria was a very kind Manemo. Everybody liked Legendaria, but Legendaria had a different side besides kindness. She felt as though somebody was inside of her, and she wanted to talk to it. She couldn't sleep until she could talk to it. When she was 16, she met it. It said its name was Legendarius, and she is part of Legendaria. Legendaria understood, and never said anything about Legendarius. When the population was about 100 Manemos, she was 92 years old. Before she disappeared, she wanted to keep the Manemos peaceful. She told everybody about her plan, then she was gone forever. But a bird was watching as she disappeared.
