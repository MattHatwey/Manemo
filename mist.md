I woke up on a misty night. There was another Manemo next to me who was staring at me. Disgusting. He was kinda cute, but not my type. He told me his name was Meru. I didn't care. Meru tried to attract me, but I wasn't interested. I liked to play with other cute girls. Especially younger ones. Their so cute! I love them. I also like helping Sansei with the laundry or dishes.
