Rigel

I remember everything from the start.

The day I was born, 4 other Manemos were there. They were Vega, Orion, Castor, and Mira. We were in a prison.

Vega was the scared one, who always purposely forgot everything.

Orion was the calm one, who just sat there thinking.

Castor was the dumb one, who always ran around and started fights.

Mira was the loud one, who randomly made comments.

And I, Rigel, was the strange one, who remembers everything.

I soon found out that the others couldn't remember anything about the past, and they soon realized we were born in the same place. 

I never forgot the past. And I can remember to when Castor was a dumb 3 year old who liked to kick everything, or when 4 year old Orion stared at me, thinking, or how 5 year old Vega stared at everything like a fret, and looked at me like I was a bomb ready to explode, or when 3 year old Mira shouted when she saw a Bad Manemo.

Recently, we escaped the prison cell because one of the Bad Manemos forgot to lock the gate. We ran toward the sunrise. As the sun rose, we watched everything come to life. The flowers, the animals, the sky, everything seemed to come to life. It felt like a miracle to me. I felt like my life just came to life with the sunrise, too. I will never forget that miracle.

We were soon chatting together, happily, until we saw a town infront of us. Then, Matt and Sansei appeared. I remember a Bad Manemo saying those names, about 4 years ago. Matt let us in the Crystal Tower.
