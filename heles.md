Heles

I was born on a hot day. The sky was clear, and it was really sunny. I saw a Manemo next to me. She was my twin sister. We were named after the Heles Charm. I am Heles, and since it reverses the Manemo's power, my twin sister's name is Reverse.

I love the Crystal Tower so much. It's so peaceful, yet, loud, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. I love that feeling.

I am told that I am bossy. I am bossy!!! I love being a leader. It's so fun. I think Reverse has PLANS but I'm not interested.
