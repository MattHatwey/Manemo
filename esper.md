Esper

I woke up on a rainy afternoon, and I couldn't see the sunset. Only my dad and mom were there. Nobody really cared about me. I went out of my new room, but nobody would even greet me. I was sad. I was lonely. 

Then I thought I would take care of future kids who were born. The next child after me was a Manemo named Crystal. She was very playful, but similar to me, nobody would really notice her. But I played with her everyday. So did she. We won contests of the best siblings ever, and I was glad to have such a great little sister! As I looked out the window one day, it was a rainy afternoon, and I couldn't see the sunset. The clouds were bright red, and as I looked, the sky became clear and I saw a beautiful view.
