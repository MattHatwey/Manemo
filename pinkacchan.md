I was born on a sunny and hot day. I was outside. Where is my house? I don't really care.

Maybe a few months later, a Manemo walked towards me. She said her name was Sansei. She said I could live in the Crystal tower. This other Manemo also came. I didn't mind her being around at all. 

When I went to elementary school, I met Mirage. I hated school. I was in this school for 1 year, but I couldn't get used to it. Then Mirage came. Nobody cared about her, but she sat next to me and started talking about this thing she saw called idols. I soon got interested in the topic. I asked how she heard about it, and she told me that she found a broken down sign about idols. And then she said that she didn't have a home. I told her that I didn't have one either, until recently, when I went to the Crystal tower. She didn't get jealous at all. I was glad. She said she liked having no connection with anything, and she said she just climbed the fence to attend this school. I loved it. Her story was so cool. I wanted to be like her. 

I once brought an idol uniform to school. So did Mirage. After that, we escaped school to go to an idol concert event. We named our group 'THE IdoLz!'. I think it is a pretty good name. We were kicked out at first, but then suddenly, we were allowed to dance in the idol concert events.

7 years later, I married this boy named Obsidian. He was the spirit of Flame, who I loved. Flame came back a few years later. Then a Peekaboo bird joined the Idol group. We renamed the group to 'Peekaboo IdoLz!'. It was perfect. It had the same IdoLz but adding Peekaboo just made our idol group stand out.
